    CSS Tutorial.
    This CSS tutorial covers everything from basic styling concepts and selectors to advanced techniques, such as
    flexbox, grid, animations, and CSS variables. This CSS tutorial is designed to help both beginners and experienced
    designers to make them masters in creating visually appealing, responsive, and modern web designs.

    What is CSS?
    CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet". It's a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
    of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS helps the web developers to control the layout and other
    visual aspects of the web pages. CSS plays a crucial role in modern web development by providing the tools
    necessary to create visually appealing, accessible, and responsive websites.

    Since the start of CSS, several versions have come into existence. Some of the notable versions include:
      - CSS1 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 1):
        The initial version of CSS, released in December 1996. CSS1 provided basic styling capabilities for HTML
        documents, including properties for text, colors, backgrounds, margins, and borders.
      - CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 2):
        Released in May 1998, CSS2 introduced new features such as positioning, z-index, media types, and more
        advanced selectors like attribute selectors and child selectors.
      - CSS2.1 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 2.1):
        This version 2.1, published as a W3C Recommendation in June 2011, clarified and refined CSS2, addressing
        inconsistencies and ambiguities in the specification. CSS2.1 focused on improving interoperability among web
        browsers.
      - CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 3:
        CSS3 is a collection of modules that extend the capabilities of CSS. It introduces many new features and
        enhancements, including advanced selectors, multiple column layouts, animations, transformations, gradients,
        shadows, and more.
      - CSS4 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 4:
        CSS4 is an ongoing effort to extend CSS3 with new features and enhancements.

    Each version of CSS builds upon the previous ones, adding new features and refining existing capabilities to meet
    the evolving needs of web developers and designers. CSS is referred to as just CSS now, without a version number.

    Types of CSS.
      - Inline CSS: Applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
              It has the highest priority among the three methods.
      - Internal CSS: IDefined within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document.
      - External CSS: Written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.
              This is the recommended method for large projects as it improves maintainability.

    Advantages of Using CSS.
      - Responsive design: CSS offers features like media queries that enable developers to create responsive layouts
        that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.
      - Flexibility and Control: CSS provides precise control over the presentation of HTML elements, allowing
        developers to customize layout, typography, colors, and other visual properties.
      - Consistency and Reusability: Developers ensure consistency across the entire website, by defining styles in a
        central CSS file. Styles can be reused across multiple pages, reducing redundancy and making updates easier.
      - Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - CSS can be used to structure content in a way that improves search engine
        visibility.
      - Ease of Maintenance: Centralized CSS files make it easier to maintain and update styles across a website.
        Changes can be applied globally, ensuring uniformity and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
      - Faster Page Loading: External CSS files can be cached by browsers, resulting in faster page loading times for
        later visits to a website. This caching mechanism reduces server load and bandwidth consumption.

    Components of CSS.
    CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. A CSS rule contains two main parts:
    - a selector which specifies the HTML element(s) to style.
    - a declaration block which contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
      Each declaration includes a property-name and value, specifying the aspect of the element presentation to control.

    What is CSS?
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, used to describe the presentation and design of web pages.
    Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns
    are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used.
    CSS can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

    Why Use CSS?
    - CSS Saves Time: You can write CSS once and then reuse the same styles across multiple HTML pages.
    - Pages Load Faster: If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag or attributes every time.
      Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag.
    - Easy Maintenance: To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be
      updated automatically.
    - Superior Styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML,
      so you can get a far better look to your HTML page.
    - Multiple Device Compatibility: For the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for
      different screen widths
    - Global Web Standards: Now that most HTML attributes are being deprecated, it is recommended to use CSS.

    CSS Syntax consists of selectors and declaration used to apply styles to HTML elements.
      selector {
        property: value;
      }

    The selector targets the HTML element(s) that you want to style.
    The declaration block contains one or more declarations enclosed in curly braces {}.
    Each declaration consists of a property and a value separated by a colon:
    Semicolons(;) separate declarations

    There are several types of selectors available in CSS, commonly used selectors are classes, IDs and tags.
    To know the complete list of selectors, visit the CSS Selectors article.

    CSS History and Versions
    Current version of CSS is CSS3.Early versions were CSS1 and CSS2.
    As of now, CSS is continuously evolving and adapting new capabilities that fulfill current websites' requirements.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS Syntax.
    CSS syntax consists of selectors and declaration used to apply styles to HTML elements.
      selector {
        property: value;
      }

    Selector: CSS selectors are used to select the HTML element or groups of elements you want to style on a web page.
    Property: An aspect or characteristic of an HTML element that can be styled or modified using CSS,
              such as color, font-size, or margin.
    Value:    Values are assigned to properties.
              For example, color property can have value like red, green, e.t.c.

    Multiple Style Rules
    If you want to define multiple rules for a single selector, you can specify those in a single block separated by a
    semicolon (;).
      selector{
        property1: value1;
        property2: value2;
        property3: value3;
      }

    CSS Selectors Syntax.
    CSS Selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style on a web page.
    They allow you to target specific elements or groups of elements to apply styles like colors, fonts, margins, etc.

    Different types of selectors are mentioned below:
      - Universal Selector........ Select and apply styles to all elements in an HTML document.
      - Element Selectors......... Select specific HTML elements.
      - Class Selectors........... Select and style an element with a specific value for its class attribute.
      - Id Selectors.............. Select a single element with a particular value for the id attribute.
      - Attribute Selectors....... Select an element based on a specific attribute value.
      - Pseudo-Element Selector... Selects and styles specific parts of an element.
      - Pseudo-Class Selector..... Selects and styles elements based on their state.

    CSS Inclusion Syntax.
    CSS can be used in any HTML document using three different methods which are: inline, internal, and external CSS.
      - Inline CSS Syntax.
        <div style="color: #04af2f;">Welcome to TutorialsPoint.</p>

      - Internal CSS Syntax.
        Internal CSS is used within the head section of an HTML document using a style tag.
            <style>
              body {
                background-color: #04af2f;
              }
            </style>

      - External CSS Syntax.
        External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using a link tag.
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

    CSS Media Queries Syntax.
    CSS media queries apply different CSS styles based on the screen size, resolution, and other characteristics
    and are often used for creating responsive designs.
      @media (max-width: 700px) {
        body {
          background-color: #04af2f;
        }
      }

    CSS Variables Syntax
    CSS Variables allows storing and reusing values throughout the CSS program.
      :root {
        --main-color: #04af2f;
      }

    CSS Comments Syntax
    CSS comments add an explanatory note about the code.
      /* This is a single line CSS comment */

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS - Comments
    Comments are useful in adding explanatory notes or annotations within your style-sheet that are not interpreted as
    styling instructions by the web browser.
    CSS comments are intended for the benefit of developers and are ignored by the browser when rendering a web page.
    They are useful in documentation, debugging, etc.

    In CSS, there are two main ways to create comments:
      - Single-line Comments: Single-line comments are created using /* to start the comment and */ to end it.
      - Multi-line Comments: Multi-line comments allow you to add comments that span multiple lines.
        They are also enclosed within /* and */.

    Inline CSS.
    Inline CSS is applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
    It has the highest priority among the three methods.
      SYNTAX: <element style = "...style rules....">

    Internal CSS.
    Internal CSS is defined within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document.

    External CSS.
    External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.
    This is the recommended method for large projects as it improves maintainability.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS Inclusion
    You need to include the CSS file in your HTML document before using it.
    There are multiple ways to include CSS in an HTML file: inline CSS, internal CSS, or including a CSS file.

    Styles can be associated with your HTML document in different ways, such as
      - Inline CSS Syntax.
        <div style="color: #04af2f;">Welcome to TutorialsPoint.</p>

      - Internal CSS Syntax.
        Internal CSS is used within the head section of an HTML document using a style tag.
            <style type="text/css">
                body {
                    background-color: #04af2f;
                }
            </style>

        Attributes associated with <style> elements are:−
          * type.... text/css
                     Specifies style-sheet language as a content-type (MIME type). This is a required attribute.
          * media... screen/tty/tv/projection/handheld/print/braille/aural/all
                     Specifies the device the document will be displayed on.
                     Default value is all. This is an optional attribute.

      - External CSS Syntax.
        External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using a link tag.
          <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

        Attributes associated with <style> elements are:−
          * type.... text/css
          * media... screen/tty/tv/projection/handheld/print/braille/aural/all
          * href.... URL
                     Specifies the style sheet file having style rules. This attribute is required.
                     Specifies the device the document will be displayed on.
                     Default value is all. This is an optional attribute.

    Imported CSS - @import Rule
    The @import is used to import an external style-sheet in a manner similar to the <link> element.
    By using @import rule, one style-sheet can be imported into another style-sheet.
    The only key point to remember is, the @import rule must be declared on top of the document.

      SYNTAX: Refer the following two CSS files; style.css and demostyle.css

      style.css
      body {
         background-color: peachpuff;
      }

      demostyle.css
      @import url("style.css");
      h1 {
            color: #36CFFF;
         }
      p {
            font-size: 1.5em;
            color: white
      }
      div {
            border: 5px inset gold;
            background-color: black;
            width: 300px;
            text-align: center
      }

      You just need to include the stylesheet that has @import rule defined in the <link> tag in the HTML document
      as follows −

      <head>
        ...
        <link type = "text/css" href = "demostyle.css">
      </head>

    CSS Rules Overriding.
    We have discussed different ways to include style sheet rules in an HTML document.
    Here is the rule to override any Style Sheet Rule.

      - Any inline style sheet takes the highest priority.
        So, it will override any rule defined in <style>...</style> tags or any external style sheet file.
      - Any rule defined in <style>...</style> tags will override rules defined in any external style sheet file.
      - Any rule defined in an external stylesheet file takes the lowest priority,
        and rules defined in this file will be applied only when the above two rules are not applicable.
      - Not forgetting, external stylesheets load in order, and the last loaded override earlier ones
      - Specificity overrides order:
            #id beats .class, which beats element
            div#hero h1 is more specific than just h1
      - !important overrides everything (but should be used sparingly as it breaks the natural cascade)

    CSS Comments Inclusion
    Many times, you may need to put additional comments in your style sheet blocks.
    So, it is very easy to comment on any part in the stylesheet.
    You can simply put your comments inside /* ...this is a comment in style sheet... */
    You can use /* ... */ to comment multi-line blocks.

    CSS - Units
    CSS Units define the measurement system used to specify the values.
    CSS offers a number of different units for expressing length and measurement.
    CSS unit is used to specify the property size for a page element or its content.

    There are a number of ways to specify and measure length in CSS.
    It is used to specify margins, padding, font size, width, height, border, etc.

    For example - font-size: 50px, here number 50 has a suffix px i.e., pixel, it is a CSS measurement unit.

    There should be no whitespace between the number and the unit. The unit can be left out when the value is 0.

    Length Units.
    Length units can be categorized into two types:
      - Absolute units: Fixed unit lengths that do not depend on screen width.
      - Relative units: Responsive unit lengths that change, according to screen width.

    Absolute Length Units.
    These units are categorized as fixed-length units, which means that lengths specified with absolute units maintain
    an exact, unchanged size on the screen.

    These units prove to be very effective when the browser has comprehensive information about the properties of the screen, the printer being used, or other appropriate user agents.

    The following are all the types of absolute units:
      - mm....... Refers to millimeter, it is used to specify the measurements in millimeters.
                  1mm = 1/10th of 1cm
      - cm....... Refers to centimeter, it is used to specify the measurements in centimeters.
                  1cm = 37.8px = 25.2/64in
      - Q........ Refers to Quarter-millimeters, it is used to specify the measurements in centimeters.
                  1Q = 1/40th of 1cm
      - in....... Refers to inches, it is used to specify the measurement in inches.
                  1in = 2.54cm = 96px
      - pt....... Refers to point, it is used to specify the measurements in points.
                  1pt = 1/72 of 1in
      - pc....... Refers to picas, it is used to specify the measurement in picas.
                  1pc = 1/6th of 1in
      - px....... Refers to pixels, it is used to specify the measurement in pixels.
                  1px = 1/96th of 1in
      - em....... Relative to the font-size of the element.
      - ex....... Relative to the x-height of the current font.
      - ch....... Relative to the width of the "0".
      - rem...... Relative to the font-size of the root element.
      - lh....... Relative to the line height of the element.
      - rlh...... t is relative to the line height of the root element.

    Absolute units prove valuable for projects where responsiveness is not a priority.
    However, they are less beneficial for responsive websites because they do not adjust when screen dimensions change.

    Relative Length Units.
    Relative length units are measured in relation to other elements or viewport of the screen.
    Relative units are great for styling responsive websites because they can be adjusted proportionally based on
    window size or parent elements. These units define lengths relative to other length properties.

    The following are all the types of relative units:

    vb.......... Relative to the size of the initial containing block in the direction of the root element block axis.
                 1vb = 1% of the containing block's size (block axis).
    vh.......... Relative to the height of the viewport.
                 1vh = 1% or 1/100 of the height of the viewport.
    vmin........ Relative to the smaller dimension of the viewport.
                 1vmin = 1% or 1/100 of the viewport's smaller dimension.
    vw.......... Relative to the width of the viewport.
                 1vw = 1% or 1/100 of the width of viewport.
    vi.......... Relative to the size of the initial containing block in the direction of the root element inline axis.
                 1vb = 1% of the containing block's size (inline axis).
    dvw, dvh.... Relative to the width and height of the dynamic viewport.
                 1dvw = 1% or 1/100 of the dynamic viewport's width
                 1dvh = 1% or 1/100 of the dynamic viewport's height.
    svw, svh.... Relative to the width and height of the smaller viewport.
                 1svw = 1% or 1/100 of the smaller viewport's width
                 1svh = 1% or 1/100 of the smaller viewport's height.
    lvw, lvh.... Relative to the width and height of the larger viewport.
                 1lvw = 1% or 1/100 of the larger viewport's width
                 1lvh = 1% or 1/100 of the larger viewport's height.
    vmax........ Relative to the larger dimension of the viewport.
                 1vmax = 1% or 1/100 of the viewport's larger dimension.

    CSS - Selectors
    CSS Selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style on a web page.
    They allow to target specific elements or groups of elements to apply styles like colors, fonts, margins, and more.
    The element or elements that are selected by the selector are referred to as subject of the selector.

    CSS Nested Selectors
    CSS nesting allows to nest one style rule inside another rule,
    with the selector of the child rule relative to the selector of the parent rule.
    The nesting selector shows the relationship between the parent and child rules.
      - When the nested selectors are parsed by the browser, it automatically adds a whitespace between the selectors,
        thus creating a new CSS selector rule.
      - In situations where the nested rule needs to be attached to the parent rule (without any whitespace),
        like while using the pseudo-class or compound selectors,
        the & nesting selector must be prepended immediately to achieve the desired result.
      - In order to reverse the context of rules, the & nesting selector can be appended.
      - There can be multiple instances of & nesting selector.

      The syntax for the universal selector is as follows:
        * {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
        }
      As per the above syntax, the universal selector is used to apply a margin and padding of 0 to all HTML elements.

      CSS Combinators

      Combinators used to specify relationship between selectors so that styling can be done based on that relationship.
      In other words combinators help you target elements based on their position and hierarchy within the HTML document.
      For example, with combinators you can style paragraph element that paaced immediately after div element.

      CSS Descendant Combinator
      Used to select elements that are nested within another element, regardless of how deeply they are nested.
      These are often represented by a single space (" ").

      CSS Child Combinator
      The child combinator (>) is used to select elements that are direct children of a specified element.
      It will not select elements that are further nested inside the child elements.

      CSS Adjacent Sibling Combinator
      Adjacent sibling combinator (+) is used to select an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element.
      It only affects the element that directly follows the specified element.

      CSS General Sibling Combinator
      The general sibling combinator (~) is used to select all elements that are siblings of a specified element and appear after it in the HTML structure. It will select all matching siblings, not just the one immediately following.

      Combining Multiple Combinators
      In CSS, you can combine multiple combinators to create more complex and specific selectors.
      By combining different combinators, you can target elements based on more complex relationships within the HTML
      structure.

      CSS Attribute Selector
      Attribute selectors allow you to select HTML elements based on the presence or value of one or more attributes.
      They are a powerful way to target specific elements in your HTML markup.
      Attribute selectors are enclosed in square brackets [] and can take various forms.
      The syntax for the attribute selector is as follows:
        a[target] {
          property1: value1;
        }

      The following sections discusses some common ways to use attribute selectors:
      - CSS [attribute] Selector
        Selects elements that have specified attribute, regardless of its value.
      - CSS [attribute="value"] Selector
        Selects elements that have a specific attribute with a specific value.
      - CSS [attribute*="value"] Selector
        Selects elements that have a specific attribute with a value containing a specific substring anywhere within it.
      - CSS [attribute^="value"] Selector
        Selects elements that have a specific attribute with a value that starts with a specific string.
      - CSS [attribute$="value"] Selector
        Selects elements that have a specific attribute with a value that ends with a specific string.
      - CSS [attribute|="value"] Selector
        Selects elements that have a specific attribute with a specific value OR the specific value followed by a hyphen
        This selector is often used for selecting elements with language-specific attributes,
        such as lang attributes, which often use hyphens to denote language subcodes.
      - CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector
        This selector is used to select elements that have a specific attribute with a value containing a specified word.
        The word should be a standalone word, surrounded by spaces or at the beginning or end of the attribute value.

      CSS Pseudo-Class Selector
      Pseudo-classes in CSS are used to select and style elements based on their state or position within the document
      tree, without the need for adding extra classes or JavaScript.

      What is Pseudo-class?
      Pseudo-classes are often used along with CSS Selectors by inserting a colon (:) after selector.
        For example a : hover{}, Here selector `a` will selects all the anchor tags in document.
      A functional pseudo-class contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments.
        For example: :lang(en).
      The element to which a pseudo-class is attached, is termed as an anchor element.
        For example: button:hover, a:focus, etc... Here button and a elements are called the anchor elements.
      Pseudo-classes apply style to an element as per the content of the document tree.
      Pseudo-classes also apply a style to an element in relation to the external factors, such as:
        - History of the navigation of the element (:visited),
        - Status of the content (:checked), or position of mouse (:hover)
      The syntax for pseudo-class selector is as follows:
        selector:pseudo-class {
          property: value;
        }

      Pseudo-Class Hover
      In CSS, pseudo-class :hover is used to specify mouse hovering state of an element.
      This used to style element while users mouse passes through an element in document.
      The syntax for pseudo-class hover selector is as follows:
        tag:hover {
           property: value;
        }

      Pseudo-Class Active
      Pseudo-class :active will apply style to an element when user activates the element by clicking or tapping on it.
      This is most commonly used with interactive elements like button and anchor tag, but all the HTML elements can use
      this pseudo-class. The syntax for pseudo-class active selector is as follows:
        tag:active {
          property: value;
        }

      Pseudo-Class Focus
      Pseudo-class :focus will apply style to an element when user focused an element like input tag by clicking on it.
      Before typing text in input element users has to click in input area to enable cursor, this is called focusing.
      The syntax for pseudo-class focus selector is as follows:
        tag:focus {
          property: value;
        }

      Pseudo-Class nth Child
      The pseudo-class :nth-child(n) will apply style to any specified direct child of an element.
      The syntax for pseudo-class nth-child(n) selector is as follows:
        tag:nth-child(number/ expression / odd / even) {
          property: value;
        }
      The pseudo-class nth-child can take number, mathematical expression or values like odd, even as parameter.

      Pseudo-Class First-Child
      The pseudo-class first-child used to select first direct child element.
      The syntax for pseudo-class first-child selector is as follows:
        tag:first-child {
          property: value;
        }

      Pseudo-Class Last-Child
      The pseudo-class last-child used to select last direct child element.
      The syntax for pseudo-class last-child selector is as follows:
        tag:last-child {
          property: value;
        }

      Pseudo-Class Lang
      The pseudo-class :lang() will apply style to an element based on value of lang attribute set to the element or
      it's parent.

      Pseudo-Class Not
      The pseudo-class :not(selector) is used to apply style on all the elements expect elements that included in
      mentioned selectors.
      The syntax for pseudo-class not selector is as follows:
        tag:not(selector){
          property: value;
        }
      The selector can be a class, id, or tag in html.

        <!--
        * Think of `n` as a free variable that takes all whole numbers starting at 0 and increasing by 1.
        * The formula (`an+b`) is evaluated for every `n`.
        * If the result is a valid child index (≥1 and ≤ number of children), then that child matches.
        * If the result is ≤0 or > the number of children, it just produces no match (not an error, just ignored).

        So it’s not recursion (nothing calls itself again) — it’s more like generating a sequence of numbers (1, 23, …),
        plugging each into the formula, and checking whether the result is a valid child index.

        * `:nth-child()` starts counting from the first child forward.
        * `:nth-last-child()` starts counting from the last child backward (same formula logic, applied from the back).

        👉
        The “engine” never stops generating results (in theory, it’s infinite),
        but in practice you “run out” when indices go outside the child range.
        See below example for a 10-item list:

        for -n+1;
        n = -0 + 1 →  1 ✅
        n = -1 + 1 →  0 ❌
        n = -2 + 1 → -1 ❌
        n = -3 + 1 → -2 ❌ ... don't continue as we will always get a negative

        for n+1;
        n = 0 + 1 →  1 ✅
        n = 1 + 1 →  2 ✅
        n = 2 + 1 →  3 ✅
        n = 3 + 1 →  4 ✅ ... continue until we run out of children

        for 3n+4;
        n = 3 * 0 + 4 → 4  ✅
        n = 3 * 1 + 4 → 7  ✅
        n = 3 * 2 + 4 → 10 ✅ ... dont continue since we only have 10 list items

        for 5n;
        n = 5 * 0 → 0   ❌ (0 is invalid, there’s no “0th child”).
        n = 5 * 1 → 5   ✅
        n = 5 * 2 → 10  ✅ ... again, dont continue since we only have 10 list items
