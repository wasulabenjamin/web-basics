    HTML - Head Elements
    HTML head elements define metadata like the title, character set, links to external stylesheets, and other details. 
    This information does not display on the webpage but is helpful for the search engines and browsers. 
    The head elements are placed inside the <head> tag.

    HTML <title> Element
    The HTML <title> tag is used for specifying the title of the HTML document. 
    The title must describe the content of the web page, and its format should be text only. 
    It appears in the title bar of the browser's tab.

    HTML <meta> Element
    The HTML <meta> tag is used to provide metadata about an HTML document. 
    Metadata is additional information about the web page, including page expiry, page author, list of keywords, page 
    description, and so forth. This information is further used for the purpose of search engine optimization. 
    Remember, the metadata specified by the <meta> tag is not displayed on the web page, but it is machine-readable. 
    Its most commonly used attributes are name, content, charset, and http-equiv.

    HTML <base> Element
    The HTML <base> tag is used for specifying the base URL for all relative URLs in a page, which means all the other 
    URLs will be concatenated into the base URL while locating the given item. 
    We are allowed to use only one base element in our HTML document.

    HTML <link> Element
    Used to specify relationships between the current webpage and another external resource. 
    The source of external resources is placed inside the href attribute. 
    The other attributes of the tag are rel, type, and media. 
    Its most common use is to embed stylesheets into the HTML document.

    HTML <style> Element
    The HTML <style> tag is used to specify styles either for the whole HTML document or for a particular element. 
    Its most common attributes are title and media.

    HTML <script> Element
    Used to include either an external script file or to define an internal script for the HTML document. 
    The script is an executable code that performs some action.

    HTML - Favicon
    HTML favicon stands for "favorite icon". 
    It is a small-sized image that displays in the browser's tab just before the page title. 
    Favicon is defined by using the <link> tag with the "rel=icon" attribute.

    A favicon is a small image that represents your website and helps users identify it among multiple tabs, bookmarks, 
    and search results. It can be in various formats, such as ICO, PNG, GIF, JPEG, or SVG, but ICO is the most widely 
    supported format. If you have ever visited a website and noticed a small icon next to the page title in your 
    browser's tab, you have seen a favicon.

    You can add a favicon to a webpage by using the <link> tag with the rel attribute set to "icon". 
    The <link> tag is a head element, so it must be placed within the <head> tag.

    To add a favicon, we need to follow these simple steps mentioned below:
      − Create or choose an image for your favicon. Its common size could be 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels. 
        There are a few online tools available that help us in creating a favicon, such as "Favicon.io" and "ionos.com".
      − Save and upload the favicon image to the website directory. 
        Make sure the image is in a format that browsers can recognize, such as PNG, GIF, or ICO.
      − Now use the <link> element, which tells the browser where to find the favicon image. 
        Remember, the <link> tag comes inside the header part, i.e., <head> tag of the HTML document.

    Different Favicons for Different Pages on a Website?
    Yes, different favicons can be added for different pages on a website. 
    You need to define the favicon images for different pages using the <link> tag (as discussed above) inside the head.

    HTML - JavaScript
    JavaScript allows you to create dynamic and interactive HTML pages. 
    JavaScript is a high-level programming language and core technology behind web developments.

    A script is a small piece of program that add interactivity to our websites. For example, a script could generate a 
    pop-up alert box message or provide a dropdown menu based on certain conditions, such as a user clicking a button. 
    This script could be written using JavaScript.

    Adding JavaScript in HTML
    There are multiple ways of adding scripts (JavaScript) to the HTML document. 
    We can keep JavaScript code in a separate file and then include it wherever it's needed, 
    or it is also possible to define functionality inside the HTML document itself.

    You can add JavaScript in an HTML document by using the <script> tag. 
    The following are the different ways to add JavaScript into an HTML page:

    Inline JavaScript
    Internal JavaScript
    External JavaScript
    Let's see both cases one by one with suitable examples.

    
    Inline JavaScript
    You can directly add JavaScript code to an HTML element on the various attributes, 
    such as onclick, onload, or any other.

    Internal JavaScript
    You can write the JavaScript code directly into our HTML document. 
    Usually, we keep script code in the header of the document inside the <script> tag; however, there is no restriction. 
    You are allowed to put the script code anywhere in the document but inside the <script> tag.

    External JavaScript
    If developers are going to define a functionality that will be used in various HTML documents, then it's better to 
    keep that functionality in a separate JavaScript file and then include that file in the HTML documents. 
    A external JavaScript file will have an extension of .js which is then imported (added) using the <script> tag by 
    providing the path to the file in the src attribute. 
    You should also define the type attribute with the "text/javascript" value.

    Event Handlers
    Event handlers are nothing but simply defined functions that can be called against any mouse or keyboard event. 
    We can define any kind of business logic inside our event handler, 
    which can vary from a single to thousands of lines of code.

    Hide Scripts from Older Browsers
    Although most browsers these days support JavaScript, some older browsers don't. 
    If a browser doesn't support JavaScript, instead of running your script, it would display the code to the user. 
    To prevent this, we can simply place HTML comments around the script as shown below.

    The <noscript> Element
    For users whose browsers do not support scripts, or for those who have disabled scripts in their browsers, 
    we can embed scripts into the web page using the <noscript> tag as illustrated in the below example.

    Default Scripting Language
    There may be a situation when we are required to include multiple script files and ultimately use multiple <script> 
    tags. We can specify a default scripting language for all the script tags at once. 
    This saves us from specifying the language every time we use a script tag within the page.

  <h2>Inline JavaScript</h2>
  <button onclick="alert('Hi there!')">Click Me</button>
  <br>

  <h2>Internal JavaScript</h2>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    function helloWorld() {
      alert('Hello Learner!');
    }
  </script>
  <button onclick="helloWorld()">Click Me</button>
  <br>

  <h2>Event Handler</h2>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    function mouseOver() {
      alert('Some cursor passed over me hoss!');
    }
  </script>
  <p onmouseover="mouseOver()">Hover over me!</p>
