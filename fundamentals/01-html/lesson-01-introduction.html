  <h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
  <!--
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    It is not a programming language, but a markup language used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
    HyperText: Refers to the "links" that connect web pages, allowing you to navigate the internet.
    Markup Language: Refers to the use of "tags" (like <h1> or <p>) to define the layout and elements of your content.
    HTML is the skeleton of the page that gives every website its shape.

    HTML Elements (Tags)
    Elements are the building blocks of HTML. Here are the most common ones you'll use every day.

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      This defines the document type as HTML5.

      <html>
      This is a root element for an HTML document. All elements are placed inside this element.

      <head>
      The head tag may contain scripts and styles that are useful page functionalities.
      Meta tags are also placed inside this tag.

      <title>
      This defines the webpage's title.

      <body>
      This defines the body of the webpage.
      All elements that are used to display content on the browser placed inside the body tag.

      Headings: <h1> to <h6>
      HTML provides six levels of headings.
      <h1> is the most important (the main title of your content), while <h6> is the least.

      Paragraphs: <p>
      The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. Browsers automatically add space before and after each paragraph.

      Links: <a>
      The <a> (or anchor) tag creates a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL to which the link points.

    Semantic HTML
    As you advance, use semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article> to add meaning to your content
    when designing or developing a web page. This improves both accessibility and SEO.

  <h1>Tags Vs. Elements Vs. Attributes</h1>
  <!--
    HTML tags
    HTML tags are the fundamental elements of HTML used for defining the structure of the document.
    These are letters or words enclosed by angle brackets (< and >).
    Usually, most of the HTML tags contain an opening and a closing tag.
    Examples include:
      - Heading Tags: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
      - Paragraph Tag: <p>
      - Line Break Tag: <br>
      - Center Tag: <center>

    HTML elements
    HTML elements are the basic building blocks to create a web page
    A HTML element is created with a start tag, a content, and an end tag.
    Some of the examples of HTML elements are as follows:
      <p>This is paragraph content.</p>
      <h1>This is heading content.</h1>
      <div>This is division content.</div>

      Nested Elements
      HTML allows nesting of elements created by placing one or more HTML elements inside an HTML element.
      Where the container element can be considered as a parent element and others are as child elements.
      We can have multiple levels of nesting; however, it requires some guidelines to follow:
        - Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag.
        - The closing tag of the parent element must come after the closing tag of the child element.
        - The nested elements must be valid HTML elements.

      Special Case: Empty (Void) Elements
      HTML void elements are those elements that don't require closing tags.
      These tags don't have any content model and even don't allow nesting of elements.
      The void elements are also known as empty or self-closing elements.
      Some of the void elements are: <img>, <hr>, and <br> elements.

      Note: You might see these tags written with a / at the end, like <br />.
            This is an older syntax and is not needed in modern HTML5.

    HTML attributes
    HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements; in order to define or change their behavior.
    Attributes are used with an opening tag. Below is the syntax of an element HTML having attribute:
      <tag_name attribute="Value">...</tag_name>

    The following are the rules and characteristics of HTML attributes;
    you should follow while using attributes with HTML elements:
      - Attributes are optional; you can use them to provide additional information about an HTML element.
      - Attributes have name and value pairs, but some of the attributes do not require any value;
        those are known as Boolean attributes.
      - An HTML element can have multiple attributes, and they should be separated by spaces.
      - Attributes should always be written with the opening tag.
      - All HTML elements can have attributes except a few like <head>, <title>, <script>, etc.
      - W3C recommends using attributes in lowercase and keeping the value in quotes.

    The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are:
      The id Attribute
      The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page.
      There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an element:
        − If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier,
          it is possible to identify just that element and its content.
        - If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet),
          you can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.

      The title Attribute
      The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element.
      The syntax for the title attribute is similar as explained for id attribute
      The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often displayed as a
      tooltip when the cursor comes over the element or while the element is loading.

      The class Attribute
      The class attribute specifies one or more CSS classes for an HTML element.
      Multiple classes can be used on a single element with this attribute.
      The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of class names if you are specifying multiple classes.
      Example: class="className1 className2 className3"

      The style Attribute
      The style attribute allows you to write inline CSS rules for an element.

    Internationalization (i18n) Attributes
    There are three internationalization attributes, which are available for most (although not all) XHTML elements.

      The dir Attribute
      The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text should flow.
      The dir attribute can take one of two values, as you can see in the table that follows
        ltr - Left to right (the default value)
        rtl - Right to left (for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic that are read right to left)

      The lang Attribute
      The lang attribute allows you to indicate the main language used in a document.
      This attribute was kept in HTML only for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of HTML.
      This attribute has been replaced by the xml:lang attribute in new XHTML documents.
      The values of the lang attribute are ISO-639 standard two-character language codes.
      Check HTML Language Codes: ISO 639 for a complete list of language codes.

      Boolean Attributes
      Boolean attributes represent true and false values and do not require any value with the attribute name.
      To set the true value, you need to write the attribute's name, and to set it false, the attribute should be
      omitted altogether.
      Boolean attributes include: disabled, readonly, required, inert, autocomplete

      The xml:lang Attribute
      The xml:lang attribute is the XHTML replacement for the lang attribute.
      The value of the xml:lang attribute should be an ISO-639 country code, as mentioned in the previous main-section.

    Generic Attributes
    Some other attributes that are readily usable with many of the HTML tags include:
      - align:....... right, left, or center............... Horizontally aligns tags
      - valign:...... top, middle, or bottom............... Vertically aligns tags within an HTML element.
      - bgcolor:..... numeric, hexidecimal, or RGB Values.. Places a background color behind an element
      - background:.. URL.................................. Places a background image behind an element
      - id:.......... User Defined......................... Names an element for use with Cascading Style Sheets.
      - class:....... User Defined......................... Classifies an element for use with Cascading Style Sheets.
      - width:....... Numeric Value........................ Specifies the width of tables, images, or table cells.
      - height:...... Numeric Value........................ Specifies the height of tables, images, or table cells.
      - title:....... User Defined......................... "Pop-up" title of the elements.
      - href:........ User Defined......................... Specifies the destination URL for a link or reference.
      - src:......... User Defined......................... Specifies the source file for media elements

    HTML Tags and Elements Case Sensitivity
    HTML tags and Elements are not case-sensitive. They can be written in uppercase or in lowercase.
    But the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends using lowercase tags starting from HTML 4.

  <h1>Headings</h1>
  <!--
    HTML headings define the hierarchy (levels) and structure of content on a webpage.
    They create a visual hierarchy, with the highest-level heading, which is h1, indicating the most important content
    or the main heading, and lower-level headings being h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 for subtopics.

    Headings are crucial for structuring content and providing a clear visual indication of the beginning of new
    sections or topics. Properly structured headings enhance readability and user experience on websites, ensuring that
    information is organized and easy to navigate.

    - Well-organized headings help search engines to understand the content structure and indexing.
    - Highlighting Important Topics: The use of heading tags properly keeps the content readable.

    The <span> Tag
    You can use the <span> tag to apply inline styles or classes to specific portions of the text within a heading.
    This allows for custom styling of text within the heading.

    The <a>Tag for Links
    To create a link within a heading, use the <a> tag.
    This is useful for headings that lead to other pages or sections of your website.

    The <em> and <strong> Tags
    These tags are used for emphasizing text within headings.
    The <em> tag italicizes the text, while <strong> makes it bold.

    The <sup> and <sub> Tags
    In heading, to include superscript or subscript text within a heading, use <sup> and <sub>.

    The <abbr> Tag for Abbreviations
    When you need to include an abbreviation or acronym in a heading, use the <abbr> tag.
    It often provides a tooltip with the full meaning.

    The <mark> Tag
    Use the <mark> tag to highlight specific text within a heading.
    It's often used to indicate search results or selected portions of text.

  <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
  <!--
    HTML paragraphs are block-level elements that are used to structure and format text content on a webpage.
    A paragraph is basically a collection of words and punctuation together.
    It allows us to organize and present textual information in a coherent and readable manner.
    The HTML <p> tag is used to create a paragraph element.

    Reason to Use Paragraphs:
    Paragraphs typically create space above and below the text, separating it from surrounding content.
    They can be styled using CSS to control aspects such as font size, color, alignment, and spacing.
    In web development, paragraphs play a crucial role in conveying information effectively, enabling clear
    communication, and enhancing the overall user experience on a website.

    Line Breaks With Paragraphs
    The <br> tags are used to insert line breaks within a paragraph to control the text layout.

    Headings With Paragraphs
    Headings, such as <h1>, provide a hierarchical structure and can be used alongside paragraphs.

    Lists With Paragraphs
    Lists can be incorporated within paragraphs for content organization.

    Emphasis Within Paragraphs
    Tags like <em> and <strong> allow you to emphasize text within paragraphs.

    Links within Paragraphs
    You can insert links within paragraphs using the <a> tag.

    Inline Styles Within Paragraphs
    You can use the <span> tag with inline styles to apply specific formatting.

    Images Within Paragraphs
    You can embed images within paragraphs using the <img> tag.

    Superscript and Subscript Within Paragraphs
    Use <sup> and <sub> tags to create superscript and subscript text.

    Abbreviations Within Paragraphs
    The <abbr> tag helps define abbreviations or acronyms.

    Citations Within Paragraphs
    The <cite> tag specifies citations and references within paragraphs.

  <h1>Block and Inline Elements</h1>
  <!--
    All the HTML elements can be categorized into two categories:
    - Block-level Elements
      HTML block elements are used to create the logical and semantic layout of a web page.
      They help to organize the content into meaningful sections and make it easier for browsers, search engines, and
      site visitors to understand the structure and meaning of different parts of the web page.
      Block-level elements start on a new line, and anything that follows them appears on the next line.
      These elements may contain margins to add some space before and after.
      These elements take up the full width of their parent elements by default; you may set their width by using the
      CSS width property.

      HTML Block-level Elements include:
        <address>    <article>    <aside>      <blockquote> <canvas>     <dd>         <div>        <dl>
        <dt>         <fieldset>   <figcaption> <figure>     <footer>     <form>       <h1 - h6>    <header>
        <hr>         <li>         <main>       <nav>        <noscript>   <ol>         <p>          <pre>
        <main-section>    <table>      <tfoot>      <ul>         <video>

    - HTML Inline Elements
      Inline elements are used to make useful block elements, like adding anchor links.
      Inline elements can appear within the same line and do not start a new line on their own.

      HTML Inline Elements Include:
        <a>          <abbr>       <acronym>    <b>          <bdo>        <big>        <br>         <button>
        <cite>       <code>       <dfn>        <em>         <i>          <img>        <input>      <kbd>

  <h1>Style Sheet</h1>
  <!--
    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a tool that defines how web documents look on screens or in print.
    Since its introduction in 1994, the W3C has encouraged the use of style sheets for web design.
    CSS lets you control the presentation of your content, whether it's on a screen, in print, or for accessibility,
    making web design more flexible and efficient.

    CSS provide easy and effective alternatives to specify various attributes for the HTML tags.
    Using CSS, you can specify a number of style properties for a given HTML element.

    Each property has a name and a value, separated by a colon (:).
    Each property declaration is separated by a semicolon (;).

    NOTE:
    Cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent.
    So when you are applying any style to an element, you have to be careful about child elements.
    You can apply different styles to children also.

    There are three ways to include CSS in your HTML document:
    - External CSS:
      Define CSS rules in a separate .css file and then include that file in your HTML document using HTML <link> tag.
    - Internal CSS:
      Define style sheet rules in the header main-section of the HTML document using <style> tag.
    - Inline CSS:
      Define style sheet rules directly along-with the HTML elements using style attribute.

  <h1>Formatting</h1>
  <!--
    HTML formatting defines the way of content representation on the webpage to improve the readability, to give the
    semantic meaning, and to improve visual styling.

    HTML formatting is done by using HTML physical and logical tags.
    In this chapter, we will learn about the text appearance with HTML formatting.

    Let's understand what are physical and logical tags:
    - Physical Tags:
      These tags are used to give the visual appearance to the textual content.
    - Logical Tags:
      These tags are used to give logical and semantic meaning to the textual content.
      There are a few logical tags that are used for screen readers, but the impact of those tags is visible on the
      browsers.

    Without formatting, nothing looks good or soothing to our eyes.
    But HTML formatting is not only for soothing the eye or making textual content attractive.
    There are few reasons to do the HTML formatting, this include:
      - The appearance of any text provides a clear view of the content intent, such as highlighting the keywords,
        putting meaningful information in the quotations, underlining the main sentence, etc.
      - Formatting helps search engines understand the content structure and is also helpful
        for search engine optimization.
      - Formatting improves the visual layout and improves the readability of the content.

    The following table has a list of common HTML formatting tags that are used for text formatting:
    * Physical Tags
      <b>........ This tag is used to make the text bold.
      <i>........ This tag is used to make the text italic.
      <small>.... This tag is used to make the text smaller.
      <u>........ This tag is used to underline text.

    * Logical Tags
      <strong>... This tag is used to bold text and give it semantic importance.
      <em>....... This tag is used to italicize text and give it semantic emphasis.

    * Other Tags
      <sup>...... This tag is used to make superscript text (slightly above the normal line).
      <sub>...... This tag is used to make subscript text (slightly below the normal line).
      <ins>...... This tag is used to indicate that content has been added (typically underlined).
      <del>...... This tag is used to indicate that content has been deleted (typically struck through).
      <mark>..... This tag is used to highlight text with a yellow background.
  -->

  <h2>Physical Tags</h2>
  <p>The <b>b tag</b> is used to make the text bold.</p>
  <p>The <i>i tag</i> is used to make the text italic.</p>
  <p>The <small>small tag</small> is used to make the text smaller.</p>
  <p>The <u>u tag</u> is used to underline text.</p>
  <br>

  <h2>Logical Tags</h2>
  <p>The <strong>strong tag</strong> is used to bold text and give it semantic importance.</p>
  <p>The <em>em tag</em> is used to italicize text and give it semantic emphasis.</p>
  <br>

  <h2>Other Tags</h2>
  <p>The <sup>sup tag</sup> is used to make superscript text (slightly above the normal line).</p>
  <p>The <sub>sub tag</sub> is used to make subscript text (slightly below the normal line).</p>
  <p>The <ins>ins tag</ins> is used to indicate that content has been added (typically underlined).</p>
  <p>The <del>del tag</del> is used to indicate that content has been deleted (typically struck through).</p>
  <p>The <mark>mark tag</mark> is used to highlight text with a yellow background.</p>

  <h1>Quotations</h1>
  <!--
    HTML Quotations
    HTML quotations allow you to include and format quoted text within your web content.
    These quotation tags help maintain proper formatting and semantics, enhancing the presentation and meaning of quoted

  <h1>Comments</h1>
  <!--
    HTML comments are non-executable lines of code that do not display on the webpage and are used to add notes or
    explanations. It is a good practice to add comments into your HTML code, especially in complex documents, to
    indicate sections of a document and any other notes to anyone looking at the code.

    HTML comments are completely ignored by web browsers, so they don't affect how your page looks or works.
    HTML comments help you and others understand your code and increase code readability

    Comments in HTML have certain rules that you need to follow. Below is the list of rules −
    - Comments do not support nesting, which means a comment cannot be put inside another comment.
    - You can't have the sequence "--" within a comment, except to close it.
    - You must also make sure that there are no spaces in the start-of-comment string.

    Commenting Style Sheets
    To comment a CSS script within a <style> tag, we need to use:
    /* symbol as a starting point and the */ symbol as an ending.

  <h1>Colors</h1>
  <!--
    HTML Colors
    HTML colors are a way of specifying the appearance of web elements.
    They are very important aspects of web design, as they not only enhance the visual appeal but also influence user
    behavior. They are also used to evoke emotions and highlight important content.

    In HTML, colors are generally defined for backgrounds, borders, and texts.
    To specify the colors, the style attribute of HTML elements is used.

    HTML Color Coding Methods
      - Color names; Here we can specify color names directly, like green, blue, or red.
      - Hex codes; Here six-digit code representing the amount of red, green, and blue that makes up the color.
      - Color decimal or percentage values;  Here a value is specified using the rgb() property.

    HTML Color Names
    We can specify a direct color name to set text or background color.
    W3C has listed 16 basic color names that will validate with an HTML validator, but there are over 200 different
    color names supported by major browsers.
    The following are the W3C standard color names that are supported by all browsers:
      .        .        .        .        .        .        .        .        .        .        .
      Black    Gray     Silver   White    Yellow   Lime     Aqua     Fuchsia  Red      Green    Blue
      Purple   Maroon   Olive    Navy     Teal

    Browser Safe Colors
    Colors can also be specified using the web-safe colors, which are formed by the combination of red, green, and blue
    (RGB) hex values. These colors range from the hexadecimal code #000000 (black) to #FFFFFF (white) and are supported
    by all computers using a 256-color palette.

    Setting Text Color
    To set the text color in HTML, we specify the color value of text inside the color property of style attribute.
    The value of color can be specified using any of the above discussed methods.

    Setting Background Color
    To set the background color for any HTML element, we specify the color value inside the background-color property of
    the style attribute. The value of color can be specified using any of the above-discussed methods.

    Setting Border Color
    To set the border color for any HTML element, we specify the color value inside the border property of the style
    attribute. The value of color can be specified using any of the above-discussed methods.

  <h1>Images</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Images
    HTML images provide visual content for web pages, enhancing user experiences and conveying information.
    They can be photographs, graphics, icons, or illustrations.

    HTML offers various elements for embedding, manipulating, and controlling images, contributing to the aesthetics and
    functionality of websites. Understanding image tags, attributes, and responsive design principles is essential for
    effective web development.

    Below is the basic syntax for HTML images:
    <img src="image_path" alt="Alternate text for the image" width="200px" height="150px" />

      src............... Defines the path of the image (image URL).
      alt............... Defines the alternate text;
                         If there is a broken link to the image path, the alternate text displays on the webpage.
      width and height.. Define the height and width for the image.

    You can use PNG, JPEG, or GIF image files based on your comfort, but make sure you specify the correct image file
    name in the src attribute. The image name is always case-sensitive.

    The alt attribute is an optional attribute but recommended as it specifies an alternate text for an image if the
    image cannot be displayed.

    Set Image Location
    Image location (path) must be clearly defined in the src attribute.
    You can follow the absolute path, which starts with root directory (/), then directory name (if any), and then image
    name with its extension.
    For example, if we have an image named "test.png" and it is stored in the "images" folder, which is in the "html"
    folder on the root directory. You can simply use an image path like "/html/images/test.png".

    Set Image Width and Height
    You can set image width and height based on your requirements using width and height attributes.
    You can specify the width and height of the image in terms of either pixels or a percentage of its actual size.

    Bordered Image
    You can specify the border and its thickness in terms of pixels using the border attribute.
    A thickness of 0 means there is no border around the picture.

    Image Alignment
    By default, the image will align at the left side of the page, but you can use the align attribute to set it in the
    center or right.

    Animated Images
    You can also use animated images (having .gif extensions) on the webpages.
    There is no specific attribute required to show animated images; you can simply set the path of the animated image
    (.gif) in the src attribute.

    Responsive Images
    You can also make the images responsive, which will automatically adjust their size based on the devices screen size
    and resolution. The following are the methods to make images responsive:

    - Using CSS: Using CSS, you can set the width of the image to 100%.
      This allows the image to scale proportionally to its parent container.
      <img src="/html/images/test.png" alt="Responsive Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
    - Using the <picture> Tag: You can also display different images in different sizes or resolutions by using the
      <picture> tag, which is useful when you want to display different images based on the device.
      <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="image_path_1">
        <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="image_path_2">
        <img src="default_image_path.jpg" alt="Responsive Image">
      </picture>

    The following table shows the supported image formats in the HTML <img> tag:
      - .jpeg/.jpg..... Joint Photographic Experts Group..... Transparency Support? No..... Animation Support? No
      - .bmp........... Bitmap Image File.................... Transparency Support? No..... Animation Support? No
      - .png........... Portable Network Graphics............ Transparency Support? Yes.... Animation Support? No

  <h1>Image Map</h1>
  <!--
    Image Maps
    HTML image maps are defined by the <map> tag. An image map enables specific areas of an image to be clickable,
    acting as links to different destinations.
    This technique is useful for creating complex navigation systems or interactive graphics on a webpage.

    By defining various shapes (rectangles, circles, and polygons) within an image, each with its own associated link,
    developers can create dynamic and interactive visual content that enhances user engagement and navigation.

    Image maps are useful for creating complex navigation, interactive diagrams, or engaging visual experiences,
    enhancing user engagement and interactivity on web pages.

    It is useful to create interactive graphics by defining clickable regions within an image.
    This allows users to interact with different image parts, triggering specific actions or links.

    The <map> tag is used to create a client-side image map, turning specific regions of an image into interactive
    elements. The <map> element serves as a container for <area> elements, each defining a clickable region with
    specific attributes.

    When used in conjunction with the <img> tag, the <map> tag establishes a connection between the image and its
    associated map. This enables web developers to create dynamic and interactive content by defining distinct clickable
    zones within an image.

    The <area> tag is used within the <map> tag to define clickable regions on an image.
    It specifies the shape, coordinates, and associated actions for each clickable area.

    - Rectangular Area: You can define a rectangular shape by assigning the rect value to the shape attribute.
      The rectangular shape requires coordinates for the top-left and bottom-right corners that you can define in
      coords attribute.
      Syntax:   <area shape="rect" coords="x1,y1,x2,y2" href="url" alt="Description">
                where..... xy1,xy2,xy3,xy4 − define coordinates of the top-left-bottom-right corners respectively.

    - Circular Area: You can define a circular shape by assigning the circle value to the shape attribute.
      The circular shape requires center coordinates (x, y) and radius (r) that you can define in coords attribute.
      Syntax:   <area shape="circle" coords="x,y,r" href="url" alt="Description">
                where..... x,y − define coordinates of the circle's center.
                           r − define coordinates of the radius of the circle.

    - Polygon Area: You can define a polygon shape by assigning the poly value to the shape attribute.
      The polygon shape requires a series of coordinates to form the shape that you can define in coords attribute.
      This can be used to create any shape, whether it be a mango or apple.
      Syntax:   <area shape="poly" coords="x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn" href="url" alt="Description">
                where..... xy1,xy2,..., xn,yn coordinates form the polygon.

    To create an image map in HTML, follow these steps with a code example −
    - Prepare Your Image: Begin with the image you want to use as an image map.
      For this example, we'll use an image file named kenya-major-towns.png.
      Use the usemap attribute in the <img> tag to link the image to the <map> tag by keeping its value to the name
      attribute of the <map>:
      Syntax:   <img src="../../assets/img/kenya-major-towns.png" usemap="#image_map">

    - Define the Image Map: Use the <map> tag to define the image map and give it a unique name with the name attribute.
      Syntax:   <map name="image_map"></map>

    - Define Clickable Areas: Within the <map> element, define clickable areas using <area> tags.
      Specify the shape (rect, circle, or poly), coordinates, and the URL to link to.
      <map name="image_map">
        <area shape="circle" coords="45,32,49" href="index.htm" alt="tutorialspoint">
        <area shape="rect" coords="245,50,85,9" href="/tutorialslibrary.htm" alt="tutorials_library">
      </map>

    - Repeat defining clickable areas for each area you want to create within the image.

  <h1>Iframes</h1>
  <!--
    HTML Iframes
    HTML iframe is an inline frame that allows you to embed another document within the current HTML document.
    Whenever you want to display another webpage within the webpage, you can use an iframe.

    In HTML, the inline frame is defined with the <iframe> tag.
    This tag creates a rectangular region at a specified place within the HTML document in which the browser can display
    an external document such as a map or another web page.

    The following is the syntax to create an inline frame (iframe) in HTML:
    Syntax:   <iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>

    The following table describe the attributes used with the <iframe> tag:
      - src: defines the URL or path of the external document. If the content of the iframe exceeds the specified
          rectangular region, HTML automatically includes the scrollbars.
          HTML allows any number of iframes, but it may affect the performance of the website.
      - name: allows to give a name to a specific frame. It is used to indicate which frame a document should be loaded
          into. This is important when you want to create links in one frame that load pages into an another frame, in
          which case the second frame needs a name to identify itself as the target of the link.
      - height: This attribute specifies the height of <iframe>. By default it is 150 pixels.
      - width: This attribute specifies the width of <iframe>. By default it is 300 pixels.
      - allow: Used to specify the permission policies to access features like microphone and camera.
      - loading: specifies the time to load a given iframe.

    Setting Height and Width of Iframes
    You can set the height and width of an HTML iframe by using the height and width attributes of the <iframe> tag.

    Styling an iframe
    You can also use the style or class attributes to apply the CSS rules on an iframe.

    Multiple Iframes
    You can embed multiple documents (webpages) within a webpage.
    HTML allows you to use multiple <iframe> tags in an HTML document.

  <h1>Phrase Elements</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Phrase Tags
    HTML phrase tags have been designed for specific purposes, though they are displayed in a similar way as other basic
    tags like <b>, <i>, <pre>, and <tt>.
    Following is the list of phrase tags, some of them are discussed in HTML formatting and quotations.
    - em.......... Emphasized Text
      Content that is enclosed within this tag is displayed as emphasized text.
      The <em> element typically renders text in italics, indicating emphasis.

    - mark........ Marked Text
      Anything that is enclosed within this tag is displayed as marked with yellow ink.

    - strong...... Strong Text
      Content that is enclosed within this tag is displayed as important text.
      This tag typically displays text in a bold font, indicating strong importance.

    - abbr........ Abbreviation Text
      You can abbreviate a text by putting it inside opening <abbr> and closing </abbr> tags.
      If present, the title attribute must contain this full description and nothing else.

    - bdo......... Directed Text
      This tag is used to override the current text direction.

    - dfn......... Special Terms
      This tag allows you to specify that you are introducing a special term.
      Its usage is similar to italic words in the midst of a paragraph.
      Typically, you would use the <dfn> element the first time you introduce a key term.
      Most recent browsers render the content of a <dfn> element in an italic font.

    - q........... Short Quoting Text
      This tag is used when you want to add a double quote within a sentence.
      By using this tag, you ensure that the enclosed text is presented as a direct quotation, enhancing readability and
      maintaining proper punctuation in your HTML document.

    - blockquote.. Long Quoting Text
      When you want to quote a passage from another source, you put it in between <blockquote>...</blockquote> tags.
      Text inside a <blockquote> element is usually indented from the left and right edges of the surrounding text and
      sometimes uses an italicized font.

    - cite ....... Citations Text
      If you are citing a text, you can indicate the source by placing it between an opening <cite>...</cite> tag.
      As you would expect in a print publication, the content of this tag is rendered in italicized text by default.

    - code........ Computer Code Text
      Any programming code to appear on a Web page should be placed inside <code>...</code> tags.
      The content of the <code> element is presented in a monospaced font, just like code in most programming books.

    - kbd ........ Keyboard Text
      If you want to tell a reader to enter some text, you can use the <kbd>...</kbd> element to indicate what should be
      typed in, as in this example.

    - pre......... Programming Variables
      The <var> element is usually used in conjunction with the <pre> and <code> elements to indicate that the content
      of that element is a variable.

    - samp........ Program Output
      This tag indicates sample output from a program, and script, etc.
      Again, it is mainly used when documenting programming or coding concepts.

    - address..... Address Text
      This tag is used to contain any address.

  <h1>Meta Tags</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Meta Tags
    This tag lets us specify metadata, which is additional important information about a document, in a variety of ways.
    The META elements can be used to include name and content pairs describing properties of the HTML document, such as
    author, expiry date, a list of keywords, document author, etc.

    HTML <meta> tag can be used to provide extra information. It's a self-closing element, meaning it doesn't require a
    closing tag but carries information within its attributes. You can include one or more meta tags in your document
    based on what information you want to keep in your document, but in general, meta tags do not impact the physical
    appearance of the document, so from the appearance point of view, it does not matter if you include them or not.

    You can add metadata to your web pages by placing <meta> tags inside the header of the document, which is
    represented by the <head> tag.

    The following metadata can be added using the <meta> tag:

    - Specifying Keywords
      You can use the <meta> tag to specify important keywords related to the document, and later these keywords are
      used by the search engines while indexing your webpage for searching purposes.
        Syntax:   <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, Meta Tags, Metadata"/>

    - Document Description
      You can use the <meta> tag to give a short description about the document.
      This again can be used by various search engines while indexing your webpage for searching purposes.
        Syntax:   <meta name="description" content="Learning about Meta Tags."/>

    - Document Revision Date
      You can use the <meta> tag to give information about the last time the document was updated.
      This information can be used by various web browsers while refreshing your webpage.
        Syntax:   <meta name="revised" content="web_basics, 11/08/2025"/>

    - Document Refreshing
      The <meta> tag can be used to specify a duration after which your web page will keep refreshing automatically.
        Syntax:   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5"/>

    - Page Redirection
      You can use the <meta> tag to redirect your page to any other webpage.
      You can also specify a duration if you want to redirect the page after a certain number of seconds.
        Syntax: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5; url=https://github.com/wasulabenjamin/web-basics"/>

    - Setting Author Name
      You can set an author name on a web page using a <meta> tag.
      Author name be specified by assigning the "author" value to the "name" attribute.
        Syntax:   <meta name="author" content="Mahnaz Mohtashim" />

    - Setting Cookies
      Cookies are data stored in small text files on your computer, and it is exchanged between a web browser and a web
      server to keep track of various information based on your web application needs.
      You can use the <meta> tag to store cookies on the client side, and later this information can be used by the Web
      server to track a site visitor. If you do not include the expiration date and time, the cookie is considered a
      session cookie and will be deleted when the user exits the browser.
        Syntax:   <meta http-equiv="cookie" content="userid=xyz; expires=Wednesday, 08-Aug-15 23:59:59 GMT;"/>

    - Specify Character Set
      You can use the <meta> tag to specify the character set used within the webpage.
      By default, Web servers and Web browsers use ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) encoding to process Web pages.
        Syntax:   <meta charset="utf-8">

  <h1>Classes & IDs</h1>
  <!--
  HTML - Classes
    The class is an important keyword in HTML. Its an attribute that can be applied to one or more elements and is used
    to style and categorize elements based on common characteristics or purpose.
    Classes allows multiple elements to share the same styling rules.
    By assigning the same class to multiple elements, you can apply CSS styles or JavaScript functionality to all of
    them simultaneously. This promotes consistency in design and layout, making it easier to manage and update a website.

    HTML class attribute is defined in the HTML code using the "class" keyword, and the styling is determined in CSS.
    This separation of content and style is a key principle in web design, facilitating the creation of visually
    appealing and organized web pages.

    To create a CSS rule for HTML elements using class attribute in CSS write a (.) followed by the class name mentioned
    in HTML element, the we can define the CSS properties with curly braces in key: value; format like color: yellow;.

    HTML classes are essential for styling and formatting web page elements consistently.
    They allow you to apply the same styles to multiple elements without repeating code, promoting maintainability and a
    cohesive design. The class attribute can be used on any HTML Elements(Except elements placed in head element).

    We can apply multiple classes to a single element by separating class names with a space.

    The most important feature of classes is their re-usability.
    You can apply the same class to multiple elements to maintain a consistent look throughout your website.

    HTML classes are versatile and serve various purposes beyond styling. The classes are frequently used to identify
    elements for JavaScript functions. For example, you can use a class to target specific elements, like buttons, and
    make them interactive through JavaScript.

    Things to Remember about Class
    - More than 1 class can be defined on any HTML element.
    - Class are used by CSS and JavaScript both to select the element.
    - The class is case sensitive so be careful when you are using to select the element.
    - Multiple elements can have the same class as well.
    - In CSS we use .className and in JavaScript getElementsByClassName() method to select the class

  HTML - id
    The id is an important keyword in HTML. HTML "id" is an attribute used to uniquely identify an element within a web
    page. It serves as a label for that element and enables JavaScript and CSS to target it specifically.

    HTML id attribute is defined in the HTML code using the "id" keyword, and the styling is determined in CSS.
    This identification helps in applying custom styles, making interactive features, and navigating within the webpage
    with precision. The "id" values must be unique within the document.

    NOTE: We highly recommend you to use classes to style any element through CSS.

    In CSS, you can target the id attribute by using a hash symbol (#) followed by the id name in HTML element.
    Avoid use id in CSS rather you can use class attribute. Ids are specially created to execute through JavaScript.

    HTML ids are essential for managing events, and changing the structure of documents.
    In order to create interactive and dynamic web pages, it gives developers the ability to target particular parts and
    provide them specialized behavior and appearance. Rarely it is used to do the styling in CSS.

    Using id Attribute through JavaScript
    The ids are frequently used to identify elements for JavaScript functions.
    For example, you can use a id to target specific elements, like paragraph, and make them interactive through Js.

    Difference between id and class in HTML
    In HTML, the id attribute uniquely identifies a single element on a page, making it useful for targeting with CSS
    and JavaScript, and it must be unique within the document.
    The class attribute, on the other hand, can be applied to multiple elements, allowing for the grouping of elements
    that share common styles or behaviors.

    Things to Remember about id
    - The id attribute should contain at least one character should be there, the starting letter should be a character
      (a-z) or (A-Z), and the rest of the letters of any type can written even special characters.
    - The id attribute does not contain any spaces.
    - Within the document every id must be unique.

  <h1>Backgrounds</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Backgrounds
    The background of a webpage is a layer behind its content, which includes text, images, colors, and various other
    elements. It is an essential part of web design that improves the overall look of a web page as well as the user
    experience.

    HTML offers multiple attributes and properties for manipulating the background of elements within a document.

    By default, our webpage background is white in color. We may not like it, but no worries.
    HTML provides the following two good ways to decorate our webpage background:
    - HTML Background with Colors
    - HTML Background with Images

    The following are the syntaxes for HTML backgrounds:
      <body background = value>
      <body style="background-color: value;">

    The value can be an English name of color, an RGB value of color, or a hexadecimal value of color.
    Following are some example codes that show how to set different styles of background for an HTML document.
    - Setting Color for Background:
      An elementary method to modify the background is by altering its color.
      The background-color property facilitates the specification of a color for an element's background.

    - Setting Image as Background:
      HTML allows us to specify an image as the background of our HTML web page or table.
      The background and background-image can be used to control the background image of an HTML element, specifically
      page body and table backgrounds. We simply need to pass the path of an image as a value to both properties.

    - Background Repeat and Position:
      Although you can set an image as the background using just HTML, in order to control it's behavior, like repeating
      and positioning, we need to use CSS.
      CSS offers options for controlling how background images repeat and their positioning. The background-repeat
      property specifies whether an image should repeat horizontally, vertically, both, or neither.
      Furthermore, the background-position property empowers developers to determine where the background image should
      be positioned within the element.

    - Setting Patterned Backgrounds:
      You might have seen many patterns or transparent backgrounds on various websites.
      This can simply be achieved by using a patterned image or transparent image in the background.
      NOTE: It is suggested that while creating patterns or transparent GIF or PNG images,
            use the smallest dimensions possible, even as small as 1x1 to avoid slow loading.
