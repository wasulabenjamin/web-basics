    HTML - Layouts
    HTML Layouts specifies the arrangement of components on an HTML web page.
    A good layout structure of the webpage is important to provide a user-friendly experience on our website.
    It takes considerable time to design a website's layout with a great look and feel.

    The below-listed elements are used to create the HTML layout's structure:
      - header..... Used to add a header main-section in an HTML web page.
                    All the content inside this tag will be on top of the webpage.
      - nav........ Represents a main-section of a page within the webpage,
                    where it has hyperlinks to other pages or parts within the page (just like the menu bar).
      - main-section.... It defines a major part of the web page where all the important content will be displayed.
      - footer..... The footer tag defines the footer main-section of the webpage.
                    This main-section typically contains copyright information and other important details.
                    It will always be at the bottom of the webpage.
      - article.... Specifies independent self-containing content such as a forum post, magazine, blog post, and so on.
      - aside...... Specifies content that is directly or indirectly related to the main content (like a sidebar).
      - details.... Specifies a tag for additional information. It requires the <summary> element.
      - summary.... Specifies a caption for the <details> element.

    Different Techniques to Create HTML Layouts
    There are four different techniques (ways) to create and design HTML layouts;
    you can create simple and multicolumn layouts using these techniques:

      - CSS Float Property....  A classic way to control position and formatting on a webpage.
      - CSS Flexbox Property..  Used for dynamic layout and to position elements in different screen sizes.
      - CSS Grid Property.....  Create a complex grid-like layout
      - CSS frameworks........  The framework, like Bootstrap, allows to create dynamic HTML layouts.

    HTML - Layout Elements
    HTML layout elements are special semantic elements that are used to define the structure and layout of a web page.
    These layout elements are useful to arrange (divide) the content into logical sections that improve the readability
    and accessibility of the webpage for readers.

    A typical HTML webpage layout has a title section, a nav bar, an index section, a content section, and a footer
    section, which can be defined using <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> elements, respectively.

    Each layout element has a specific meaning and function and can be customized with attributes and styles.
    They describe the content they contain, not just the appearance of a web page. They are as follows:

    HTML <header> Element
    The <header> element is used to add a header section in an HTML web page.
    It serves as a container for the introductory and navigational part of a page.
    All the content inside this tag will be on top of the webpage.
    Providing a header section helps search engines to understand your contents easily and rank the page accordingly.

    HTML <nav> Element
    The <nav> element represents a section of a page within the webpage, where it has hyperlinks to other pages or parts
    within the page (just like the menu bar). It is usually included inside a <header> element or <section> element.

    HTML <section> Element
    The <section> element defines a major part of the web page where all the important content will be displayed.
    There can be multiple sections in a single page

    HTML <footer> Element
    The <footer> element defines the footer section of the webpage.
    This section contains copyright information, social media links, and other important details.
    It will always be at the bottom of the webpage.

    HTML <article> Element
    Specifies independent, self-contained content such as a forum post, magazine, blog post, and so on.
    When an HTML article element is nested, the inner element represents the article related to the outer element.
    For example, comments on social media posts can be an article element nested in the article representing the
    social media post.
    It is mostly used for forum posts, magazine or newspaper articles, blog entries, product cards, etc.

    HTML <aside> Element
    The <aside> element example specifies a section of content that is directly or indirectly related to the main
    content (like a sidebar). If you remove aside content from a web page, the main content will not be impacted because
    aside content is a separate, optional component of the page. This tag is often used for advertisements.

    HTML Layout Using CSS
    HTML layout using CSS involves creating the structural content of a webpage and styling it with CSS properties.
    By using the CSS properties, you can create responsive and attractive webpages.

    HTML Layout Using CSS float Property
    The float property of CSS allows you to control the positioning of the web page components.
    When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and shifted to the specified
    position, such as left or right.

    HTML Layout Using CSS display:flex Property
    The CSS flexbox (also known as Flexible Box Layout) is a more efficient way of designing a layout.
    It allows developers to arrange and distribute spaces among multiple components of a web page.
    To use the features of Flexbox, we need to set the display property to flex or inline-flex.

    HTML Layout Using CSS display:grid Property
    Defines a grid of rows and columns.
    It also provides abilities to control the sizing as well as the positioning of web page contents.

    HTML Responsive Web Design
    Responsive web design means creating HTML webpages that work well on different devices and browsers.
    The pages automatically adjust to fit various screen sizes and viewports.

    Responsive web design is an approach that allows the creation of the webpages compatible with different screen
    sizes, resolutions, and devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
    It helps in improving the user experience, accessibility, and performance of a website.

    When a responsive website, such as TutorialsPoint.com, is accessed on any device of different dimensions, the
    content is displayed optimally without any overflow or overlap with other elements.
    The content remains consistent across devices, but its arrangement adapts to ensure readability.

    Best Practices for Making Webpages Responsive
    There are several ways by which we can make our webpage responsive.
    A general practice is to make use of inbuilt CSS or bootstrap frameworks that provide pre-designed components and
    grid systems. Here are some general steps to ensure the responsiveness of a webpage.

      - Use Responsive Grid Layouts
        Always design your layout with a flexible grid structure,
        so when the size of the screen increases, the grid will extend accordingly.
      - Use Responsive Images and Media
        Ensure that the images on the webpage are properly scaled within their containers.
        You can use CSS properties like "max-width: 100%;" and "height: auto.".
      - Use Media Queries
        You can use CSS media queries to apply different styles for different screen sizes.
        This allows you to adjust the layout, font sizes, and other design elements based on the device's width.
      - Use a Meta Tag with Viewport
        The viewport meta tag inside the HTML <head> tag ensures proper scaling and rendering on mobile devices.
      - Use Relative Units
        Use relative units like em, rem, or percentages for font sizes, padding, and margins
        to ensure that text scales appropriately.

    Using the Viewport for Responsive Design
    The viewport represents the visible area of a user's device.
    The content that is outside of the viewport can be seen if scrolled.
    It helps web pages render well on different devices by controlling the width and scale of the page.

    To control the viewport, add the following <meta> tag in the <head> section −
    <meta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale = 1.0">

    The above tag tells the browser to match the page width to the screen's width and set the initial zoom
    level when the page is first loaded by the user.

    We can adjust viewport settings for width, initial-scale, maximum-scale, minimum-scale, and user-scalable.
    These adjustments can make our website more accessible and user-friendly.

    Attributes of the Meta Viewport Tag for Responsiveness
    The following attributes of the <meta> viewport tag are used for responsiveness −
      - width................. It controls the width of the virtual viewport.
      - height................ It controls the height of the virtual viewport.
      - initial-scale......... It specifies the initial zoom level of the viewport when a web page is first loaded.
      - minimum-scale......... It specifies the minimum zoom level to which the user can zoom the page.
      - maximum-scale......... It defines the maximum zoom level to which the user can zoom the page.
      - user-scalable......... It specifies whether the user can zoom in or out.
      - interactive-widget.... It defines how the interactive UI widgets affect the viewport.

    Creating Responsive Text
    In HTML, to make responsive text that adjusts its font size automatically based on the viewport,
    we need to use the font-size property of CSS along with the "vw" length unit.
    The vw is an abbreviation that stands for view width or viewport width, which is a relative length unit of CSS.

    The relative length units are always calculated with respect to another element's size.
    Note that 1vw is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport.

    Creating Responsive Images
    In HTML, we can create images that are responsive, meaning they can adjust their size to fit the viewport.
    To do so, we can either set the image's width property to 100% or the max-width property to 100%.
    The width property can scale the image larger than its original size,
    on the other hand, the max-width property ensures the image does not scale beyond its original size.

    Responsive Design Using Media Queries
    The CSS media query serves as a filter that enables us to style the web page selectively for different devices.
    A single web page can have multiple media queries, each for a specific screen size.
    To define these screen sizes, we use the media query breakpoints and style the HTML elements accordingly.

    HTML - Symbols
    You can embed the symbols and special characters that are not available on the keyboard using the HTML entities.

    HTML symbols are some characters that hold a special meaning and are difficult to type directly on the keyboard.
    They are often termed as "symbols." For example, other than the dollar symbol, we can’t find any currency symbols
    like rupees and euros on normal keyboards. However, HTML provides other ways to insert these symbols into webpages.

    Inserting Symbols in HTML Document
    To insert symbols into an HTML document, we use entities.
    If no entity name exists, then we can use the entity number, which is a decimal or a hexadecimal reference.
    An HTML entity is a piece of text that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).
    They are used to represent characters and symbols that are either reserved in HTML or not directly available on
    keyboards for use on the web page.

    There are two types of HTML entities: named entities and numeric entities.
    - Named entities use a descriptive name to refer to a character or symbol, such as &copy; for the copyright symbol.
    - Numeric entities use a number to refer to a character or symbol, such as &#169; for the same symbol.

    HTML - Emojis
    Emojis are allowed to include in our webpages to represent emotions in plain text.
    Emojis are widely used in social media, messaging apps, and web pages to add some humour and feelings to the text.
    For example, 😈, 😁, 😉

    What are Emojis?
    Emojis are small graphical symbols or icons that represent emotions, objects, animals, flags, nature, food items and
    many more related entities.
    Although emojis look like graphical symbols, they are actually characters of the UTF-8 character set.

    How to add Emojis to HTML document?
    To add emojis into an HTML document, our first step should be defining the character encoding for the web page.
    For this purpose, we use the charset attribute of <meta> tag. Note that <meta> tag is used within the <head> tag.
    The charset attribute is UTF-8 as it covers over a million characters including emojis.

    There are two ways of adding emojis to the HTML document:

      - Using Decimal Code:
        We can add emojis into the HTML document using their corresponding decimal codes.
        These codes start with &#, ends with ";" and in-between they contain numerics.
      - Using Hexadecimal Code:
        We can also specify emojis using their respective hexadecimal codes.
        The hexadecimal codes for emojis start with &#x and end with ";" and in-between they contain numerics.

    HTML - Style Guide
    In HTML, the style guide is a set of rules and conventions that define how to write and format code.
    It helps to ensure that the written code is readable, understandable and easy to modify.
    A style guide helps avoid common errors and bugs that can affect the functionality and appearance of a web page.

    - Start with HTML5 Doctype
      Always start all HTML and XHTML documents with <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
      It's required to enforce the full standard mode to provide more consistent rendering of web pages.
      It is the latest web standard described by W3C and used by the layout engines of modern web browsers.

    - Specify document language
      Always specify the document language with the help of lang attribute.
      This attribute is defined within the opening <html> tag, which is the root of HTML document.
      Specifying language will help in accessibility, speech analysis, translation and other functionalities.

    - Define Charset
      The W3C always recommend developers to declare the charset or character encoding explicitly.
      It can be done by using the charset attribute of <meta> tag.
      UTF-8 is the most commonly used character encoding and provides over a million characters.

    - Use Lowercase for elements and attributes
      Dont capitalize the element names, attribute names and values of attributes.
      In other programming languages like Java, C and C++, developers often use the camel case or snake case for
      declaring the variable names. However, for writing HTML code, W3C recommends the use of lowercase letters.
      Doing so will enhance the clarity and readability of our HTML code.

    - Quote the attribute values
      According to W3C recommendations, it is better to enclose attribute values in double quotes.
      This is important for values containing spaces, as HTML may not parse them correctly without the quotes.
      The use of double quotes is more common than single quotes. However, we can use single quotes as well.

    - Use proper Indentation
      The use of proper indentation shows the structure and hierarchy of our HTML code.
      Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation, and use a consistent number of spaces (usually 2 or 3) per level.
      Also, we can use the blank lines to separate large code blocks.

    - Set the viewport
      Setting the viewport helps web pages render well on different devices.
      It is achieved by controlling the width and scale of the page.
      It is used for ensuring the responsiveness of a particular web page.

    - Add Comments
      We use comments to explain the purpose or functionalities of the particular HTML code.
      Avoid using comments for styling or scripting purposes.
