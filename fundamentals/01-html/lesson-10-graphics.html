  <h1>SVG</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - SVG
    HTML SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is used to define vector graphics in XML that can be embedded into HTML pages.
    SVG is different from normal images because it retains its quality even when zoomed in.

    XML is an abbreviation that stands for Extensible Markup Language, and it is a data description language.
    It does not have any predefined tags; hence, the users are required to define their own tags depending on the need.

    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG helps us to draw any type of images using XML coding.
    Zooming an XML vector does not lose its quality.
    It is mostly useful for vector-type diagrams like pie charts and 2-dimensional graphs in an X, Y coordinate system.
    SVG became a W3C Recommendation on 14 January 2003.

    Bitmap vs. Scalable Vector Graphics
    The PNG, GIF, and JPG files are bitmap graphics and SVG files are vector graphics.
    The main difference between these two is that bitmap graphics are made up of a grid of tiny pixels but,
    vector graphics are defined by coding hence vector graphics does not lose quality after zooming.

    Embedding SVG in HTML Using <img> Tag
    You can embed an SVG file in the HTML document using the <img> tag by specifying the file name along with the path
    in the src attribute. You can also define a direct URL to the SVG image.
    Example: <img src = "svg_file_name.svg" alt="Alternate Text" />

    Embedding SVG in HTML Using <svg> Tag
    HTML allows embedding SVG directly by using the <svg>...</svg> tag, which has the following syntax:

    There are some predefined SVG elements that are used to draw various shapes. They are as follows:
      - <rect>....... Used to define a rectangle in vector graphics for a given width and height as attributes.
      - <circle>..... Used to define a circle for given coordinates of the top-left corner and radius as an attribute.
      - <ellipse>.... Used to define an ellipse for given coordinates of the top-left corner,
                      the length of the major axis, and the length of the minor axis as attributes.
      - <line>....... Used to draw a line for the given two coordinates as an attribute.
      - <polyline>... Used to define a polyline for given coordinates of a series of connected points.
      - <polygon> Used to define a polygon for given coordinates that joins in a straight line.

    The following table contains a list of attributes of SVG elements:
      - X.......... The top-left x-axis coordinate.
      - Y.......... The top-left y-axis coordinate.
      - width...... The width of the rectangle figure.
      - height..... The height of the rectangle figure.
      - rx......... The x-axis' roundness of the ellipse.
      - ry......... The y-axis' roundness of the ellipse.
      - style...... Indicate an inline style.

   It's a common misconception that a star shape requires 10 points (5 outer and 5 inner).
   However, a star shape can be created with just 5 points.
   The points are ordered to trace the star path in one continuous line:
    - From the top tip (100, 5) to the bottom left tip (40, 180).
    - Then to the right inner point (190, 60).
    - Then to the left inner point (10, 60).
    - Then to the bottom right tip (160, 180).
    - Finally, back to the top tip (100, 5) (automatically closed by fill="purple").

  <h1>Canvas</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Canvas
    HTML element <canvas> gives you an easy and powerful way to draw graphics using JavaScript. 
    It can be used to draw graphs, make photo compositions or do simple (and not so simple) animations.

    The Rendering Context
    The <canvas> is initially blank, and to display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context. 
    The canvas element has a DOM method called getContext, which is used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing 
    functions. This function takes one parameter, the type of context 2d.

    Drawing Rectangles
    There are three methods that draw rectangles on the canvas:
      - fillRect(x,y,width,height)............... Draws a filled rectangle.
      - strokeRect(x,y,width,height)............. Draws a rectangular outline.
      - clearRect(x,y,width,height).............. Clears the specified area and makes it fully transparent

      Here x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle 
      and width and height are width and height of the rectangle.

    HTML Canvas - Drawing Paths
    We require the following methods to draw paths on the canvas:
      - beginPath().... Resets the current path.
      - moveTo(x, y)... Creates a new subpath with the given point.
      - closePath().... Marks the current subpath as closed, 
                        then starts a new subpath with a point the same as the start and end of the newly closed subpath.
      - fill()......... Fills the subpaths with the current fill style.
      - stroke()....... Strokes the subpaths with the current stroke style.
      - arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)
                        Adds points to the subpath such that the arc described by the circumference of the circle 
                        described by the arguments, starting at the given start angle and ending at the given end angle, 
                        going in the given direction, is added to the path, connected to the previous point by a 
                        straight line.

    Drawing Lines
    We require the following methods to draw lines on the canvas:
      - beginPath().... Resets the current path.
      - moveTo(x, y)... Creates a new subpath with the given point.
      - closePath().... Marks the current subpath as closed, 
                        thene starts new subpath with a point the same as the start and end of the newly closed subpath.
      - fill()......... Fills the subpaths with the current fill style.
      - stroke()....... Strokes the subpaths with the current stroke style.
      - lineTo(x, y)... Adds the given point to the current subpath, connected to the previous one by a straight line.

    Drawing Bezier Curves
    We need the following methods to draw Bezier curves on the canvas:
      - beginPath().... Resets the current path.
      - moveTo(x, y)... Creates a new subpath with the given point.
      - closePath().... Marks the current subpath as closed, and starts a new subpath with a point the same as the start 
                        and end of the newly closed subpath.
      - fill()......... Fills the subpaths with the current fill style.
      - stroke()....... Strokes the subpaths with the current stroke style.
      - bezierCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, x, y)........... Adds the given point to the current path, 
                        connected to the previous one by a cubic Bezier curve with the given control points.

      The x and y parameters in bezierCurveTo() method are the coordinates of the end point. 
      cp1x and cp1y are the coordinates of the first control point, 
      and cp2x and cp2y are the coordinates of the second control point.

    Drawing Quadratic Curves
    We require the following methods to draw quadratic curves on the canvas:
      - beginPath().... Resets the current path.
      - moveTo(x, y)... Creates a new subpath with the given point.
      - closePath().... Marks the current subpath as closed, and starts a new subpath with a point the same as the start 
                        and end of the newly closed subpath.
      - fill()......... Fills the subpaths with the current fill style.
      - stroke()....... Strokes the subpaths with the current stroke style.
      - quadraticCurveTo(cpx, cpy, x, y)........... Adds the given point to the current path, 
                        connected to the previous one by a quadratic Bezier curve with the given control point.

      The x and y parameters in quadraticCurveTo() method are the coordinates of the end point. 
      The cpx and cpy are the coordinates of the control point.

    Using Images
    You can import an external image into a canvas and then draw on that image by using following methods:
      - beginPath().... Resets the current path.
      - moveTo(x, y)... Creates a new subpath with the given point.
      - closePath().... Marks the current subpath as closed,
                        Then starts a new subpath with a point the same as the start and end of the newly closed subpath.
      - fill()......... Fills the subpaths with the current fill style.
      - stroke()....... Strokes the subpaths with the current stroke style.
      - drawImage(image, dx, dy)... Draws the given image onto the canvas. Here image is a reference to an image or 
                        canvas object. x and y form the coordinate on the target canvas where our image should be placed.

    Create Gradients
    HTML canvas allows us to fill and stroke shapes using linear and radial gradients using the following methods:
      - addColorStop(offset, color)
        Adds a color stop with the given color to the gradient at the given offset. 
        Here 0.0 is the offset at one end of the gradient, 1.0 is the offset at the other end.
      - createLinearGradient(x0, y0, x1, y1)
        Returns a CanvasGradient object that represents a linear gradient that paints along the line given by the 
        coordinates represented by the arguments. 
        The four arguments represent the starting point (x1,y1) and end point (x2,y2) of the gradient.
      - createRadialGradient(x0, y0, r0, x1, y1, r1)
        Returns a CanvasGradient object that represents a radial gradient that paints along the cone given by the 
        circles represented by the arguments. The first three arguments define a circle with coordinates (x1,y1) and 
        radius r1 and the second a circle with coordinates (x2,y2) and radius r2.

    Styles and Colors
    HTML canvas provides the following two important properties to apply colors to a shape:

      - fillStyle..... This attribute represents the color or style to use inside the shapes.
      - strokeStyle... This attribute represents the color or style to use for the lines around shapes

      By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black which is CSS color value #000000.

    Text and Fonts
    HTML canvas provides capabilities to create text using different font and text properties listed below:
      - font [ = value ]........................ Returns the current font settings and can be set, to change the font.
      - textAlign [ = value ]................... Returns the current text alignment settings and can be set, to change 
          the alignment. The possible values are start, end, left, right, andcenter.
      - textBaseline [ = value ]................ Returns the current baseline alignment settings and can be set, to 
          change the baseline alignment. Possible values are top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic and bottom
      - fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth ] )..... Fills the given text at the given position indicated by the given 
          coordinates x and y.
      - strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth ] )... Strokes the given text at the given position indicated by the given 
          coordinates x and y.

    Pattern and Shadow
    There is following method required to create a pattern on the canvas:
      - createPattern(image, repetition)... This method will use image to create the pattern. The second argument could 
          be a string with one of the following values: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, and no-repeat. If the empty string 
          or null is specified, repeat will. be assumed

    Create Shadows
    HTML canvas provides capabilities to create nice shadows around the drawings. 
    All drawing operations are affected by the four global shadow attributes.
      - shadowColor[= value]..... Returns current shadow color and can be set, to change the shadow color.
      - shadowOffsetX[= value]... Returns current shadow offset X and can be set, to change the shadow offset X.
      - shadowOffsetY[= value]... Returns current shadow offset Y and can be set, change the shadow offset Y.
      - shadowBlur[= value]...... Returns current level of blur applied to shadows and can be set, to change blur level.

    Save and Restore States
    HTML canvas provides two important methods to save and restore the canvas states. 
    The canvas drawing state is basically a snapshot of all the styles and transformations that have
    been applied and consists of the followings:
      - The transformations such as translate, rotate and scale etc.
      - The current clipping region.
      - The current values of the following attributes − strokeStyle, fillStyle, globalAlpha, lineWidth, lineCap, 
        lineJoin, miterLimit, shadowOffsetX, shadowOffsetY, shadowBlur, shadowColor, globalCompositeOperation, font, 
        textAlign, textBaseline.

    Canvas states are stored on a stack every time the save method is called, and the last saved state is returned from 
    the stack every time the restore method is called.
      - save()........... This method pushes the current state onto the stack..
      - restore()........ This method pops the top state on the stack, restoring the context to that state.

    Translation
    HTML canvas provides translate(x, y) method which is used to move the canvas and its origin to a different point in 
    the grid. Here x is the amount the canvas is moved to the left or right, and y is the amount it's moved up or down

    Rotation
    HTML canvas provides rotate(angle) method which is used to rotate the canvas around the current origin.
    This method only takes one parameter and that's the angle the canvas is rotated by. 
    This is a clockwise rotation measured in radians.

    Scaling
    HTML canvas provides scale(x, y) method which is used to increase or decrease the units in our canvas grid. 
    This can be used to draw scaled down or enlarged shapes and bitmaps.
    This method takes two parameters where x is the scale factor in the horizontal direction and y is the scale factor 
    in the vertical direction. Both parameters must be positive numbers. 
    Values smaller than 1.0 reduce the unit size and values larger than 1.0 increase the unit size. 
    Setting the scaling factor to precisely 1.0 doesn't affect the unit size.

    Transforms
    HTML canvas provides methods which allow modifications directly to the transformation matrix. 
    The transformation matrix must initially be the identity transform. 
    It may then be adjusted using the transformation methods.
      - transform(m11, m12, m21, m22, dx, dy)
        This method changes the transformation matrix to apply the matrix given by the arguments.
      - setTransform(m11, m12, m21, m22, dx, dy)
        This method changes the transformation matrix to the matrix given by the arguments .

    The transform (m11, m12, m21, m22, dx, dy) method must multiply the current transformation matrix with the matrix 
    described by:
            m11     m21     dx
            m12     m22     dy
            0       0       1

    The setTransform(m11, m12, m21, m22, dx, dy) method must reset the current transform to the identity matrix, and 
    then invoke the transform(m11, m12, m21, m22, dx, dy) method with the same arguments.

    Composition
    HTML canvas provides compositing attribute globalCompositeOperation which affect all the drawing operations.
    We can draw new shapes behind existing shapes and mask off certain areas, clear sections from the canvas using
    globalCompositeOperation. There are following values which can be set for globalCompositeOperation:
      - source-over....... This is the default setting and draws new shapes on top of the existing canvas content.
      - source-in......... The new shape is drawn only where both the new shape and the destination canvas overlap. 
                           Everything else is made transparent.
      - source-out........ The new shape is drawn where it doesn't overlap the existing canvas content.
      - source-atop....... The new shape is only drawn where it overlaps the existing canvas content.
      - lighter........... Where both shapes overlap the color is determined by adding color values.
      - xor............... Shapes are made transparent where both overlap and drawn normal everywhere else.
      - destination-over.. New shapes are drawn behind the existing canvas content.
      - destination-in.... The existing canvas content is kept where both the new shape and existing canvas content 
                           overlap. Everything else is made transparent.
      - destination-out... The existing content is kept where it doesn't overlap the new shape.
      - destination-atop.. The existing canvas is only kept where it overlaps the new shape. 
                           The new shape is drawn behind the canvas content.
      - darker............ Where both shapes overlap the color is determined by subtracting color values.

    Animations
    HTML canvas provides necessary methods to draw an image and erase it completely. 
    We can take Javascript help to simulate good animation over a HTML canvas.
    Following are the two important Javascript methods which would be used to animate an image on a canvas:
      - setInterval(callback, time)...... Repeatedly executes the supplied code after a given timemilliseconds.
      - setTimeout(callback, time)....... Executes the supplied code only once after a given time milliseconds.
