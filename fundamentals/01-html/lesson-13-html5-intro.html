    HTML5 - Overview
    HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1.
    HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
    HTML5 is a cooperation between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology
    Working Group (WHATWG).

    The new standard incorporates features like video playback and drag-and-drop that have been previously dependent on
    third-party browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Google Gears.

    Browser Support
    The latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera all support many HTML5 features and
    Internet Explorer 9.0 will also have support for some HTML5 functionality.

    Mobile browsers that come pre-installed on iPhones, iPads, and Android phones all have excellent support for HTML5.

    New Features
    HTML5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that can help you in building modern websites.
    Here is a set of some of the most prominent features introduced in HTML5:
      - New Semantic Elements: These are like <header>, <footer>, and <section>.
      - Forms 2.0: Improvements to HTML web forms where new attributes have been introduced for <input> tag.
      - Persistent Local Storage: To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins.
      - WebSocket: A next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web applications.
      - Server-Sent Events: Introduces events which flow from web server to the web browsers, Server-Sent Events (SSEs).
      - Canvas: This supports a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program with JavaScript.
      - Audio & Video: You can embed audio or video on your webpages without resorting to third-party plugins.
      - Geolocation: Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web application.
      - Microdata: Lets you create your own vocabularies beyond HTML5 and extend your web pages with custom semantics.
      - Drag and drop: Drag and drop the items from one location to another location on the same webpage.

    Backward Compatibility
    HTML5 is designed, as much as possible, to be backward compatible with existing web browsers.
    Its new features have been built on existing features and allow you to provide fallback content for older browsers.

    It is suggested to detect support for individual HTML5 features using a few lines of JavaScript.

    ---

    HTML5 - Syntax
    HTML 5 language has a "custom" HTML syntax that is compatible with HTML 4 and XHTML1 documents published on the Web,
    but is not compatible with the more esoteric SGML features of HTML 4.

    HTML 5 does not have the same syntax rules as XHTML where we needed lower case tag names, quoting our attributes,
    an attribute had to have a value and to close all empty elements.

    HTML5 comes with a lot of flexibility and it supports the following features:
      - Uppercase tag names.
      - Quotes are optional for attributes.
      - Attribute values are optional.
      - Closing empty elements are optional.

    The DOCTYPE
    DOCTYPEs in older versions of HTML were longer because the HTML language was SGML based and therefore required a
    reference to a DTD. HTML 5 authors would use simple syntax to specify DOCTYPE as follows âˆ’
      <!DOCTYPE html>

    Character Encoding
    HTML 5 authors can use simple syntax to specify Character Encoding as follows:
      <meta charset="UTF-8">

    The <script> and <link> tag
    It's common practice to add a type attribute with a value of "text/javascript" to script elements and "text/css" to
    css elements. HTML 5 removes extra information required and you can use simply following syntax:
      <script src="scriptfile.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylefile.css">

    HTML5 Elements
    HTML5 elements are marked up using start tags and end tags.
    Tags are delimited using angle brackets with the tag name in between.
    The difference between start tags and end tags is that the latter includes a slash before the tag name.

    HTML5 tag names are case insensitive and may be written in all uppercase or mixed case,
    although the most common convention is to stick with lowercase.

    Most of the elements contain some content like <p>...</p> contains a paragraph.
    Some elements, however, are forbidden from containing any content at all,
    and these are known as void elements. For example, br, hr, link, meta, etc.

    HTML5 Attributes
    Elements may contain attributes that are used to set various properties of an element.
    Some attributes are defined globally and can be used on any element, while others are defined for specific elements
    only. All attributes have a name and a value and look like as shown below in the example.

    Attributes may only be specified within start tags and must never be used in end tags.
    HTML5 attributes are case insensitive and may be written in all uppercase or mixed case,
    although the most common convention is to stick with lowercase.

    HTML5 Document
    The following tags have been introduced for better structure:
      - section... Represents a generic document or application section.
                   It can be used together with h1-h6 to indicate the document structure.
      - article... Represents an independent piece of content of a document,such as a blog entry or newspaper article.
      - aside..... Represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.
      - header.... Represents the header of a section.
      - footer.... Represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright, e.t.c
      - nav....... Represents a section of the document intended for navigation.
      - dialog.... Can be used to mark up a conversation.
      - figure.... Can be used to associate a caption together with some embedded content, such as a graphic or video.

  <h1>Web Forms 2.0</h1>
  <!--
    HTML5 - Web Forms 2.0
    Web Forms 2.0 is an extension to the forms features found in HTML4. 
    Form elements and attributes in HTML5 provide a greater degree of semantic mark-up than HTML4 and free us from a 
    great deal of tedious scripting and styling that was required in HTML4.

    The <input> element in HTML5
    HTML4 input elements use the type attribute to specify the data type.
    HTML4 provides following types:
      - text....... A free-form text field, nominally free of line breaks.
      - password... A free-form text field for sensitive information, nominally free of line breaks.
      - checkbox... A set of zero or more values from a predefined list.
      - radio...... An enumerated value.
      - submit..... A free form of button initiates form submission.
      - file....... An arbitrary file with a MIME type and optionally a file name.
      - image...... A coordinate, relative to a particular image's size, with the extra semantic that it must be the 
                    last value selected and initiates form submission.
      - hidden..... An arbitrary string that is not normally displayed to the user.
      - select..... An enumerated value, much like the radio type.
      - textarea... A free-form text field, nominally with no line break restrictions.
      - button..... A free form of button which can initiates any event related to button.

    The <input> element in HTML5
    Apart from the above attributes, HTML5 input elements introduced several new values for the type attribute. 
    HTML5 provides following types:
    
    Sr.No.  Type & Description
    - date............. A date (year, month, day) encoded according to ISO 8601.
    - datetime......... A date and time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, fractions of a second) encoded 
                        according to ISO 8601 with the time zone set to UTC.
    - datetime-local... A date and time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, fractions of a second) encoded 
                        according to ISO 8601, with no time zone information.
    - time............. A time (hour, minute, seconds, fractional seconds) encoded according to ISO 8601.
    - month............ A date consisting of a year and a month encoded according to ISO 8601.
    - week............. A date consisting of a year and a week number encoded according to ISO 8601.
    - number........... It accepts only numerical value. The step attribute specifies the precision, defaulting to 1.
    - range............ The range type is used for input fields that should contain a value from a range of numbers.
    - email............ It accepts only email value in the format email@example.com only and declines anything else.
    - url.............. It accepts only URL value in http://www.example.com format or in http://example.com format only.

    The <output> element in HTML5
    HTML5 introduced a new element <output> which is used to represent the result of different types of output, 
    such as output written by a script.

    You can use the for attribute to specify a relationship between the output element and other elements in the 
    document that affected the calculation (for example, as inputs or parameters). 
    The value of the for attribute is a space-separated list of IDs of other elements.

    The placeholder attribute in HTML5
    HTML5 introduced a new attribute called placeholder. 
    This attribute on <input> and <textarea> elements provide a hint to the user of what can be entered in the field. 
    The placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds.

    The autofocus attribute in HTML5
    This is a simple one-step pattern, easily programmed in JavaScript at the time of document load, 
    automatically focus one particular form field.

    The required attribute in HTML5
    Now you do not need to have JavaScript for client-side validations like empty text box would never be submitted 
    because HTML5 introduced a new attribute called required which would insist to have a value
