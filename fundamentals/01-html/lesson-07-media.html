  <h1>Video Element</h1>
  <!--
    HTML Video
    The HTML <video> element embeds and shows a video on the webpage.
    You can embed any type of video content on the webpage by using the <video> element.

    HTML <video> Element
    The <video> element is used to enable video playback support within a web page.
    It works very similarly to the <img> element, as it also requires adding the path or URL of the video within
    the src attribute. HTML supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg video formats widely.

    The <video> element also supports audio; however, the <audio> element is more suitable for that purpose.

    Embedding Videos in HTML
    To embed a video inside a web page, you need to set the src attribute inside the <video> tag that specifies the path
    or URL for the video. A web page serves content to a wide variety of users with various types of browsers.
    Each browser supports different video formats (MP4, WebM, and Ogg) as mentioned earlier.
    Therefore, we can supply all the formats that HTML supports by including multiple <source> tags.
    Let the browser decide which format is more suitable for video playback.

    The controls Attribute
    You can also enable the built-in controls for controlling audio and video playback for the users (if needed) with
    the help of the controls attribute. It provides an interface that enables users to manage video playback functions
    such as volume adjustment, video navigation (forward and backward), and play or pause operations.

    Customizing Video Display Size
    To set (adjust) the dimensions of the video display area, also known as the viewport,
    you can use the height and width attributes of the <video> element.
    These attributes define the height and width of the video viewport in pixels.

    Note that the video will adjust its aspect ratio (e.g., 4:3 and 16:9) to align with the specified height and width.
    Therefore, it is advisable to match the dimensions of the viewport for a better user experience.

    HTML Video autoplay and loop Attributes
    You can configure the video to play automatically in a loop by using the autoplay and loop attributes.
    Remember, a few browsers like Chrome 70.0 do not support the autoplay feature unless the muted attribute is used.
    Therefore, it is recommended to use autoplay and muted attributes together.

    Setting a Video Thumbnail
    You can pass a URL of an image that works as a thumbnail for the video within the poster attribute of the <video>
    element. It will display the specified image until the video starts playing.

  <h1>Audio Element</h1>
  <!--
    HTML Audio
    The HTML <audio> element embeds an audio file to the webpage.
    You can add an audio player inside a webpage using the <audio> element.

    HTML <audio> Element
    The <audio> element is used to enable the support of audio files within a web page.
    We can include multiple sources of audio; however, the browser will choose the most appropriate file automatically.
    Most of the attributes of <video> element is also compatible with the <audio> element.
    The most frequently used attributes of the HTML audio element are controls, autoplay, loop, muted, and src.

    The following are the attributes used with the <audio> tag:
      - controls.... This attribute adds built-in audio controls for play, pause, and volume.
      - autoplay.... This attribute allows playing the audio automatically when the page is loaded.
      - loop........ This attribute allows looping of the audio.
      - muted....... This attribute mutes the audio by default when the page is loaded.
      - preload..... This attribute specifies how the audio should be preloaded by the browser.
      - src......... This attribute specifies the path to the audio file.  File URL

    Embedding an Audio in HTML
    You can embed an audio player using the <audio> tag by specifying the audio file path.
    The audio file path can be defined either by setting the src attribute or by including the <source> tag.

    The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which audio formats browsers should support in the audio tag.
    But the most commonly used audio formats are ogg, mp3, and wav.
    Therefore, it is possible to supply all these formats by using multiple <source> tags within the <audio> element.
    Let the browser decide which format is more suitable for audio playback.

    It is necessary to use the controls attribute so that users can manage audio playback functions such as volume
    adjustment, forward or backward navigation, and play or pause operations.

    Using autoplay, muted, and loop Attributes in Audio Player
    We can also configure the audio to play automatically in a loop by using the autoplay and loop attributes.
    Remember, the Chrome browser does not support the autoplay feature unless the muted attribute is used.
    Therefore, it is recommended to use autoplay and muted attributes together.
    The autoplay is a Boolean attribute used to play the audio automatically once the page is loaded.
    If the loop attribute is present on the <audio> element, the audio sound will automatically rewind to the beginning once the end of the audio is reached.

  <h1>Embed Multimedia</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Embed Multimedia
    In the previous chapters, we have used the <audio> and <video> elements to add music and videos into our web page.
    There are other alternative ways to add videos, sounds, images, or any other external content to the website by
    using HTML tags <embed>and<object>.

    These tags cause the browser itself to include controls for the multimedia automatically:

    HTML <embed> tag
    Uused to embed external content such as images, videos, and web applications.
    It is often used for embedding content like Flash movies or audio/video players.

    SYNTAX:    <embed src = "url_of_resource">

    The following are the attributes used with the <embed> tag:
       - width.... Width attribute is used describe width of the embedded file in pixels.
       - height .. Height of the embedded file in pixels.
       - title.... It is used to label the content. The title should describe the content.
       - src...... URL of the file to be embedded.
       - type .... It indicates the type of input like mp4 and mp3.

    HTML <object> tag
    Used to embed various types of external resources, including images, videos, PDFs, and other web resources.
    It can render multiple types of files.

    SYNTAX:    <object data="url_of_resource" type="typeOfResource">

    The following are the attributes used with the <object> tag:
       - data..... The location or path of the resource is passed into data attribute.
       - type..... It indicates the type of resource.
       - height... It signifies the height of the resource display area.
       - width.... It signifies the width of the resource display area.
       - form..... Its value is the id of a form. The form attribute shows which object is associated with the form.
       - name..... It specify a unique name for the object.
       - usemap... Specifies a URL of a client-side image map to be used with the object.

    Comparison between <object> and <embed> Tags
    - Usage:             object.... Embeds multimedia like audio, video, Java applets, ActiveX, PDF, and Flash.
                         embed..... Primarily used to embed multimedia content
    - Attributes:        object.... Supports attributes like data, type, width, and height.
                         embed..... Supports attributes like src, type, width, and height.
    - HTML5:             both embed and object are supported
    - Fallback Content:  object.... Can include fallback content within the tag
                         embed..... Cannot include fallback content within the tag

    The object tag supports fallback content, which means if a version of a browser does not support the object tag,
    then the content written inside the object tag is displayed instead of the object tag.
