  <h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
  <!--
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    It is not a programming language, but a markup language used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
    HyperText: Refers to the "links" that connect web pages, allowing you to navigate the internet.
    Markup Language: Refers to the use of "tags" (like <h1> or <p>) to define the layout and elements of your content.
    HTML is the skeleton of the page that gives every website its shape.

    HTML Elements (Tags)
    Elements are the building blocks of HTML. Here are the most common ones you'll use every day.

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      This defines the document type as HTML5.

      <html>
      This is a root element for an HTML document. All elements are placed inside this element.

      <head>
      The head tag may contain scripts and styles that are useful page functionalities.
      Meta tags are also placed inside this tag.

      <title>
      This defines the webpage's title.

      <body>
      This defines the body of the webpage.
      All elements that are used to display content on the browser placed inside the body tag.

      Headings: <h1> to <h6>
      HTML provides six levels of headings.
      <h1> is the most important (the main title of your content), while <h6> is the least.

      Paragraphs: <p>
      The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. Browsers automatically add space before and after each paragraph.

      Links: <a>
      The <a> (or anchor) tag creates a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL to which the link points.

    Semantic HTML
    As you advance, use semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article> to add meaning to your content
    when designing or developing a web page. This improves both accessibility and SEO.

  <h1>Tags Vs. Elements Vs. Attributes</h1>
  <!--
    HTML tags
    HTML tags are the fundamental elements of HTML used for defining the structure of the document.
    These are letters or words enclosed by angle brackets (< and >).
    Usually, most of the HTML tags contain an opening and a closing tag.
    Examples include:
      - Heading Tags: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
      - Paragraph Tag: <p>
      - Line Break Tag: <br>
      - Center Tag: <center>

    HTML elements
    HTML elements are the basic building blocks to create a web page
    A HTML element is created with a start tag, a content, and an end tag.
    Some of the examples of HTML elements are as follows:
      <p>This is paragraph content.</p>
      <h1>This is heading content.</h1>
      <div>This is division content.</div>

      Nested Elements
      HTML allows nesting of elements created by placing one or more HTML elements inside an HTML element.
      Where the container element can be considered as a parent element and others are as child elements.
      We can have multiple levels of nesting; however, it requires some guidelines to follow:
        - Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag.
        - The closing tag of the parent element must come after the closing tag of the child element.
        - The nested elements must be valid HTML elements.

      Special Case: Empty (Void) Elements
      HTML void elements are those elements that don't require closing tags.
      These tags don't have any content model and even don't allow nesting of elements.
      The void elements are also known as empty or self-closing elements.
      Some of the void elements are: <img>, <hr>, and <br> elements.

      Note: You might see these tags written with a / at the end, like <br />.
            This is an older syntax and is not needed in modern HTML5.

    HTML attributes
    HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements; in order to define or change their behavior.
    Attributes are used with an opening tag. Below is the syntax of an element HTML having attribute:
      <tag_name attribute="Value">...</tag_name>

    The following are the rules and characteristics of HTML attributes;
    you should follow while using attributes with HTML elements:
      - Attributes are optional; you can use them to provide additional information about an HTML element.
      - Attributes have name and value pairs, but some of the attributes do not require any value;
        those are known as Boolean attributes.
      - An HTML element can have multiple attributes, and they should be separated by spaces.
      - Attributes should always be written with the opening tag.
      - All HTML elements can have attributes except a few like <head>, <title>, <script>, etc.
      - W3C recommends using attributes in lowercase and keeping the value in quotes.

    The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are:
      The id Attribute
      The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page.
      There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an element:
        âˆ’ If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier,
          it is possible to identify just that element and its content.
        - If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet),
          you can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.

      The title Attribute
      The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element.
      The syntax for the title attribute is similar as explained for id attribute
      The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often displayed as a
      tooltip when the cursor comes over the element or while the element is loading.

      The class Attribute
      The class attribute specifies one or more CSS classes for an HTML element.
      Multiple classes can be used on a single element with this attribute.
      The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of class names if you are specifying multiple classes.
      Example: class="className1 className2 className3"

      The style Attribute
      The style attribute allows you to write inline CSS rules for an element.

    Internationalization (i18n) Attributes
    There are three internationalization attributes, which are available for most (although not all) XHTML elements.

      The dir Attribute
      The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text should flow.
      The dir attribute can take one of two values, as you can see in the table that follows
        ltr - Left to right (the default value)
        rtl - Right to left (for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic that are read right to left)

      The lang Attribute
      The lang attribute allows you to indicate the main language used in a document.
      This attribute was kept in HTML only for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of HTML.
      This attribute has been replaced by the xml:lang attribute in new XHTML documents.
      The values of the lang attribute are ISO-639 standard two-character language codes.
      Check HTML Language Codes: ISO 639 for a complete list of language codes.

      Boolean Attributes
      Boolean attributes represent true and false values and do not require any value with the attribute name.
      To set the true value, you need to write the attribute's name, and to set it false, the attribute should be omitted altogether.
      Boolean attributes include: disabled, readonly, required, inert, autocomplete

      The xml:lang Attribute
      The xml:lang attribute is the XHTML replacement for the lang attribute.
      The value of the xml:lang attribute should be an ISO-639 country code, as mentioned in the previous section.

    Generic Attributes
    Some other attributes that are readily usable with many of the HTML tags include:
      - align:....... right, left, or center............... Horizontally aligns tags
      - valign:...... top, middle, or bottom............... Vertically aligns tags within an HTML element.
      - bgcolor:..... numeric, hexidecimal, or RGB Values.. Places a background color behind an element
      - background:.. URL.................................. Places a background image behind an element
      - id:.......... User Defined......................... Names an element for use with Cascading Style Sheets.
      - class:....... User Defined......................... Classifies an element for use with Cascading Style Sheets.
      - width:....... Numeric Value........................ Specifies the width of tables, images, or table cells.
      - height:...... Numeric Value........................ Specifies the height of tables, images, or table cells.
      - title:....... User Defined......................... "Pop-up" title of the elements.
      - href:........ User Defined......................... Specifies the destination URL for a link or reference.
      - src:......... User Defined......................... Specifies the source file for media elements

    HTML Tags and Elements Case Sensitivity
    HTML tags and Elements are not case-sensitive. They can be written in uppercase or in lowercase.
    But the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends using lowercase tags starting from HTML 4.

  <h1>Headings</h1>
  <!--
    HTML headings define the hierarchy (levels) and structure of content on a webpage.
    They create a visual hierarchy, with the highest-level heading, which is h1, indicating the most important content
    or the main heading, and lower-level headings being h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 for subtopics.

    Headings are crucial for structuring content and providing a clear visual indication of the beginning of new
    sections or topics. Properly structured headings enhance readability and user experience on websites, ensuring that
    information is organized and easy to navigate.

    - Well-organized headings help search engines to understand the content structure and indexing.
    - Highlighting Important Topics: The use of heading tags properly keeps the content readable.

    The <span> Tag
    You can use the <span> tag to apply inline styles or classes to specific portions of the text within a heading.
    This allows for custom styling of text within the heading.

    The <a>Tag for Links
    To create a link within a heading, use the <a> tag.
    This is useful for headings that lead to other pages or sections of your website.

    The <em> and <strong> Tags
    These tags are used for emphasizing text within headings.
    The <em> tag italicizes the text, while <strong> makes it bold.

    The <sup> and <sub> Tags
    In heading, to include superscript or subscript text within a heading, use <sup> and <sub>.

    The <abbr> Tag for Abbreviations
    When you need to include an abbreviation or acronym in a heading, use the <abbr> tag.
    It often provides a tooltip with the full meaning.

    The <mark> Tag
    Use the <mark> tag to highlight specific text within a heading.
    It's often used to indicate search results or selected portions of text.

  <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
  <!--
    HTML paragraphs are block-level elements that are used to structure and format text content on a webpage.
    A paragraph is basically a collection of words and punctuation together.
    It allows us to organize and present textual information in a coherent and readable manner.
    The HTML <p> tag is used to create a paragraph element.

    Reason to Use Paragraphs:
    Paragraphs typically create space above and below the text, separating it from surrounding content.
    They can be styled using CSS to control aspects such as font size, color, alignment, and spacing. In web development, paragraphs play a crucial role in conveying information effectively, enabling clear communication, and enhancing the overall user experience on a website.

    Line Breaks With Paragraphs
    The <br> tags are used to insert line breaks within a paragraph to control the text layout.

    Headings With Paragraphs
    Headings, such as <h1>, provide a hierarchical structure and can be used alongside paragraphs.

    Lists With Paragraphs
    Lists can be incorporated within paragraphs for content organization.

    Emphasis Within Paragraphs
    Tags like <em> and <strong> allow you to emphasize text within paragraphs.

    Links within Paragraphs
    You can insert links within paragraphs using the <a> tag.

    Inline Styles Within Paragraphs
    You can use the <span> tag with inline styles to apply specific formatting.

    Images Within Paragraphs
    You can embed images within paragraphs using the <img> tag.

    Superscript and Subscript Within Paragraphs
    Use <sup> and <sub> tags to create superscript and subscript text.

    Abbreviations Within Paragraphs
    The <abbr> tag helps define abbreviations or acronyms.

    Citations Within Paragraphs
    The <cite> tag specifies citations and references within paragraphs.
