  <h1>HTML Tables</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Tables
    HTML tables represent data, such as text, images, etc. in a structured format with rows and columns. These offers a 
    visual structure that aids in clarity and comprehension, making them a fundamental element in web development.

    HTML tables are used for various reasons, primarily centered around organizing and presenting data effectively. 
    Some key purposes include:
    − Structuring Data: 
      Tables provide a coherent structure for organizing and displaying data, 
      making it easier for users to interpret information.
    - Comparative Presentation: 
      When there is a need to compare different sets of data side by side like difference between two concepts, 
      tables offer a clear and visually accessible format.
    - Tabular Data Representation:
      Information that naturally fits into rows and columns, such as schedules, statistics, or pricing tables, 
      can be well-represented using HTML tables.
    
    You can create a table in HTML by using the <table> tag along with several tags that define the structure and 
    content inside the table. 

    The primary tags that are used in creating a table in HTML are:
    - <table>... This tag is used to create the table that wrap the rows and columns within it.
    - <tr>...... Stands for "table row" and is used to create a row within the table.
    - <th>...... Represents "table header" and is used to create header cells within a row.
    - <td>...... Represents "table data" and is used to create standard cells within a row.
    
    HTML Table Structure - Rows and Columns:
    - Rows: Each row in an HTML table is defined using the `<tr>` tag. 
      It contains a set of table cells (`<td>` or `<th>`), representing the individual elements within that row.
    - Columns: The actual data or header information is contained within the table cells. 
      Cells in the same position in different rows form a column.
    - A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns of the table.
    - Table heading is defined by the <th>...</th>. Data inside the <th> are the headings of the column of a table.
    - Each table cell is defined by a <td>...</td> tag. 
      Data inside the <td> tag are the content of the table rows and columns.
    - Each table row starts with a <tr> ....</tr> tag.
    - We use style sheet to create border for the table.

    Styling HTML Tables
    You can also style an HTML table using CSS properties to give it a custom appearance. Either you can create classes 
    to apply styles on a table, or you can simply write internal CSS properties to style the table.
    It is recommended that you should use CSS to style an HTML table. 
    The background-color and background-image properties are used to set background color and image respectively.

      Table Width and Height
      The table's width and height can be set using either attributes or CSS properties.
      These values can be defined in pixels or percentages.
      The following attributes can set the width and height of a table:
      - width: It defines the width of the table.
      - height: It defines the height of the table.
      
      The following CSS properties can set the width and height of a table:
        table { width: 80%; height: 400px; }

    HTML Nested Tables
    Nested HTML tables refer to create tables inside a table. 
    You can create tables inside a table by using the <table> tab inside any <td> tag, 
    it creates another table in the main table's cell.

    Table-related Tags Reference
    The following are the table-related tags.
    - <table>...... It is used to create HTML table.  
    - <th>......... This tag defines the header of the table. 
    - <tr>......... This tag defines a table row. 
    - <td>......... This tag is used to store table data of each cell.  
    - <caption>.... This tag specifies the caption for the table. 
    - <colgroup>... This tag describes the collection of one or more columns in a table for formatting.  
    - <col>........ This tag is used to offer information about columns.  
    - <thead>...... This tag is used to define table header section.  
    - <tbody>...... This tag is used to define table body section.  
    - <tfoot>...... This tag is used to define the table footer section.

  <h1>Table Headers & Captions</h1>
  <!--
    HTML Table Headers and Captions
    Headers and captions are used inside tables to organize and present data in a structured format.

    The table heading is an essential part of a table, providing labels for columns. 
    The <th> (table header) element is used to define table headings.

    Captions are used in the tables to provide a title or explanation for the table. 
    The <caption> element is placed immediately after the opening table tag.

    The following is the syntax to create a header and caption for an HTML table:
        <table>
          <caption>Description of table</caption>
          <tr>
             <th>heading 1</th>
             <th>heading 2</th>
             <th>heading 3</th>
          </tr>
        </table>
    
    Define a Header Row for a Table
    The <th> tag is used to represent table headings, and it is typically used within the <tr> (table row) element. 
    Unlike the <td> (table data) tag used for regular cells, <th> is reserved for headers. 
    In most cases, the first row of a table is designated as the header row.

    Styling Table Headings
    Styling table headings can enhance the visual appeal of a table. 
    CSS can be applied to <th> elements to customize their appearance.

    Using Header Cells in Any Row
    While it's common to use <th> in the first row of a table, you can utilize it in any row based on your requirements. 
    This flexibility allows for the creation of complex tables with multiple header rows or headers interspersed within 
    the table.

    Table Header Using <thead> Element
    The <thead> tag is used to group table header cells so that a combined CSS style can be applied to header cells.

    The <thead> tag is typically placed within the <table> element and contains one or more <tr> elements, each of 
    which, in turn, contains <th> elements representing column headers.

    Defining Multiple Header Rows
    You can include multiple <tr> elements within <thead> to create multiple header rows. This is useful when your table 
    structure requires a more complex hierarchy of headers.

    Using '<colgroup>' Inside '<thead>'
    The <colgroup> tag can be used within <thead> to group together a set of column and apply CSS styling or attributes 
    to entire columns.
     
    Combining with '<tfoot>' and '<tbody>'
    The <thead> tag is often combined with <tfoot> (table footer) and <tbody> (table body) to create a comprehensive 
    table structure.

    Difference between <thead> and <th>
    Following are the points that highlight the differences between <thead> and <th> −

    The <thead> tag is a structural element used to group header content, while <th> is a cell-level element defining a 
    header cell.
    It's common to use <th> within <thead>, but <th> can also be used outside <thead> to define headers in regular rows.
    Including <thead> is optional; however, using it improves the semantic structure of the table.
    Adding Caption to a HTML Table
    The caption tag will serve as a title or explanation for the table, and it shows up at the top of the table.

    Table Header, Body, and Footer
    Tables can be divided into three portions: a header, a body, and a foot. The head and foot are rather similar to 
    headers and footers in a word-processed document that remain the same for every page, while the body is the main 
    content holder of the table.

    The three elements for separating the head, body, and foot of a table are −

    The <thead> tag to create a separate table header.
    The <tbody> tag to indicate the main body of the table.
    The <tfoot> tag to create a separate table footer.
    
    A table may contain several <tbody> elements to indicate different pages or groups of data. 
    But it is notable that <thead> and <tfoot> tags should appear before <tbody>
      - <thead> contains column headings → screen readers can use them to label data cells in <tbody>.
      - <tfoot> contains summary data or totals → having it defined early helps assistive technologies know what to 
        expect before reading through all <tbody> rows.

    Multiple <tbody> groups still use the same <thead> and <tfoot>, so defining them first makes structural sense.

  <h1>Table Styling</h1>
  <!--
    HTML - Table Styling
    You can style HTML tables by using the CSS. Table styling helps you to customize the normal appearance of the 
    elements like borders, cell padding, text alignment, background colors, and more to create a well-formatted table on 
    a webpage.

    Collapsed Border Table
    You have the flexibility to manage the space between table borders by manipulating the 'border-collapse' property. 
    This property determines how adjacent table cell borders interact, and adjusting it allows you to control the 
    spacing or gap between the borders within your table.
    By setting 'border-collapse' to "collapse", borders will merge, eliminating any spacing, 
    while "separate" allows you to control the spacing using the 'border-spacing' property, 
    providing a more customized appearance to your table layout.

    Horizontal Zebra Striped Table
    The Zebra Stripes - Horizontal technique involves styling table rows with alternating colors, 
    enhancing the visual appeal and readability of the table.
    The :nth-child(even) selector targets every even row, and a background color is applied to create a striped effect.

    Text Alignment in Table Cells
    You can align the text within your table cells horizontally and vertically using the text-align and vertical-align 
    properties.

    Vertical Zebra Striped Table
    The Zebra Stripes - Vertical technique enhances table readability by applying alternating styles to every other 
    column. This is achieved using the :nth-child(even) selector for both (td) and (th) elements.

    Table with Combined Vertical & Horizontal Zebra Stripes
    You can achieve a captivating visual effect by combining both horizontal and vertical zebra stripe patterns on your 
    table. This involves applying alternating styles to both rows and columns.
    To enhance this effect, consider adjusting the color transparency using the rgba() function, 
    creating an engaging and aesthetically pleasing overlap of stripes for a unique and visually interesting outcome.

    Table with Horizontal Dividers
    You can enhance the visual structure of your table by incorporating horizontal dividers. Achieve this effect by 
    styling each '<tr>' element with a bottom border.

    Hoverable Table Rows
    You can improve user interaction by employing the ':hover' selector, which highlights table rows when users hover 
    over them. This enhances the visual feedback, making the table more interactive and user-friendly.

  <h1>Table Colgroup</h1>
  <!--
    HTML Table Colgroup
    In HTML, the <colgroup> element is used to define a group of columns in a table. It allows you to apply properties 
    to multiple columns simultaneously, providing a more efficient way to style or format columns.

    The <colgroup> Tag
    The <colgroup> is often used in conjunction with the <col> element, where each <col> tag represents an individual 
    column within the group. This grouping enhances readability and simplifies the application of styles or attributes 
    to specific columns in a table.

    CSS Properties for <colgroup> Tag
    In HTML, the <colgroup> element allows some specific CSS properties to enhance the presentation of table columns. 
    The legal CSS properties that can be used within a <colgroup> are as follows:
    - width Property: This property sets the width of the columns within the <colgroup>. 
      It allows you to define the relative or absolute width of each column.
    - visibility Property: Used to control the visibility of columns within the <colgroup>. 
      You can set it to "hidden" to make a column invisible.
    - Background Properties: Background properties, such as background-color, can be applied to add background styling 
      to the columns. This can enhance the visual appeal of the table.
    - Border Properties: Border properties, like border-color and border-width, enable the customization of borders 
      around the columns. This is useful for creating well-defined visual boundaries.

    Attempting to apply other CSS properties will have no impact on the styling of the table columns. 
    Therefore, when styling tables with <colgroup>, focus on the available properties to achieve the desired layout and 
    appearance.

    Multiple Col Elements
    The <colgroup> element allows you to group a set of columns in a table and apply styles to them collectively. 
    Within <colgroup>, you can use multiple <col> elements to define different styles for individual columns.

    Empty Column groups
    In HTML, a <colgroup> element can be used to define a group of columns in a table. 
    An empty <colgroup> can be employed to provide a structural placeholder for potential styling or later use
    While it doesn't contain explicit <col> elements, it can still influence the overall structure of the table.

  <h1>Nested Tables</h1>
  <!--
    Nested Tables
    HTML nested tables refer to the table where one or more tables are placed inside it; the inner tables are placed 
    inside the <td> tag. The nested tables involve the utilization of one table within another, providing a versatile 
    way to structure complex data layouts. 
    Various elements, including other HTML tags, can be incorporated within table cells (<td>).

    Not only can tables be nested, but various HTML tags can also be used within the <td> (table data) tag for arranging 
    content in a structured manner.

    Tables Within Cells
    Tables can be nested within table cells, allowing for complex structures.

    Styling Nested Tables
    You can apply styles to nested tables just like regular tables to enhance visual appearance. 
    To write CSS styles for nested tables, you can simply apply the CSS rules on the 'table' selector to style the outer 
    table and use the 'table table' selector to style the inner tables.

    Additionally, nested tables within cells inherit a distinctive style, including a colored background and borders. 

    Images in Nested Tables
    Embedding images within nested tables enhances visual presentation. 
    Use the <img> tag inside table cells to seamlessly integrate images into complex layouts like nested tables.

    Following are the advantages of the nested tables −
    - Organized Layouts:
      Nested tables enable the creation of organized and structured layouts, enhancing the presentation of complex data.
    - Cell Customization:
      Each cell in a nested table can contain diverse content, including text, images, or even additional nested tables.
    - Complex Designs:
      Achieve intricate design patterns by nesting tables within cells, providing flexibility in webpage design.
